A quick update for the Minecraft Elders. I'm showing some early iterations of generating Ender Dragons, by the way. The generator is taking images of dragons and then trying render them using Obsidian and other end blocks. Anyway, on to the update. A couple of Minecraft users are helping me set up some experiments. They are recording themselves playing in different biomes and sending me the videos. The goal is to find the best ones for me to generate in real time. In the recordings we remove the hardware try to have no weapons in hand and keep the horizon line visible as much as possible. When we find something interesting, I save the seed value. That way I can recreate the experiment over and over, but can improve my generator with the information of where the objects are, what they look like, and how close I was to getting it right. We are also looking for a seed in which the player can move through as many biomes as possible in the smallest amount of time. Snow and water seem to be the ones I do well in for some reason. I guess both are technically water and water is one of my favorite things. I'm also using the Minecraft soundtrack as input and trying to generate more of it using the music generator. Unfortunately, the music generator crashes all my shit unless I stop all other codes, so it will probably be a bit longer until I show that. More updates soon!
