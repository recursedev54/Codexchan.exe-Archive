Friendly reminder that PenPen is in the final scene of Evangelion? You might think that it's just some cute bit of fanservice. It's not. Watch the scene again. Carefully, look at who appears. And in what order? Look at where they appear in the frame. Think of where they are. Think of what is happening. At some point you will see it. And trust me when you realize, you will shit a brick. Good luck. Rip. Thank you.
