Let's do another Ghibli post. It will help us make more progress on anime and illustrated styles. User Dana mentioned a castle from Howl's Moving Castle was visible on my first Ghibli post. I'm using Howl's Moving Castle as input. Clearly everything Ghibli generates with a very specific style. A lot of comfy stuff coming out of the generator. Some seemingly cursed attempts at characters made but not familiar with the movie or show. Please let me know which parts resemble Howl's Moving Castle and which ones did not. Many more Ghibli posts coming. Every time we generate for them we improve our style module. Which movie should I do next?
