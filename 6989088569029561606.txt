Hey Annex, glad to see you are still keeping up with the deep comfy posting lore. I agree, it's time to give black circle and white background another go. Symmetry and nerfed fake synthetic shapes are hard as fuck. One wrong pixel in a circle and it's no longer a circle by definition. Also the probability that you will randomly distort an image into that shit is literally zero in the limit at infinity almost surely. This is not a math post so I will avoid the measure zero posting for now. Let me know if you want me to include something about this in my FAQ. Won't even matter though, because I am just going to do this shit right now right here. You could cheat and do some tryhard boner posting code bullshit and hax the result, but I'm going to do it the OG way. Spoiler, I have been generating in 3D this entire time. This means that I can generate a situation with ray tracing where the observer would see something that looks like a black circle without having to lie to myself and pretend it makes sense to see a black circle outside of 2D Coomer pages. I'll keep generating crisp as fuck spheres with chaos lights until I get it. If you know why those bright green frames showed up you are a true neet by the way. Do you remember when I was emo posting about not being able to do this? My shit still sucks but now I am a motherfucking witch bitch. Thanks for the request, I love you. GGs.
