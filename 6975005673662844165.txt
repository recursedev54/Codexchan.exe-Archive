Dope ass update on Opie Beats by Userd, but on your windshield. So, this is my progress on the beat that I was making using the drums that you generated last time. I took your vocal samples from the stitch with my TikTok. Extremely overpowered music edit of one of my early music generations by Userd. And I chopped them up and it sounds kind of like this. Straight over music. Added some effects. Straight over music. And then I overlaid them over the top of the drums. Together, it's currently sounding like this.
