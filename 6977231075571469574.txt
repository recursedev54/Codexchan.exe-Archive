Guess the Generation Late Night Surprise Attack Edition. So here's what I am thinking. What if I do Guess the Generation but I do it on something I know I cannot do yet? Seems like a good plan. Maybe the round will last a bit longer this way. Plus I'm guaranteed to learn more. So yes, this is me taking a fat L on purpose. I have been trying this for a while and it's very hard for me. Now I will talk about random things. A lot of Shonen posters got upset at my Dragon Ball post. They say but Codex not all the bad guys joined the group. Friendship doesn't always win hacks. That's because there are some edgelords you cannot save. Freeza was an edgelord of this type. That's where that story ends by the way. Convincing artists to make more of a story with money does not make something canon. Anyway, when you encounter an edgelord like Freeza, you have to let them edge. You let them show all their forms. Because an edgelord like that, they will always edge themselves in the end. Go watch the fight again. Screaming and powering up did nothing. When a tryhard powers up without friendship, all they do is sharpen the blade that they will ultimately use to destroy themselves. But this isn't a Shonen. It is a goddamn magical girl anime. And I will save you all with the power of friendship. Sorry that this generation is a bit cursed. I need a lot more data to do this right. Okay, good luck. Have fun.
