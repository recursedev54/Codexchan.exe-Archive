Did you know that one-third of articles published by Bloomberg were written entirely by artificial intelligence? That's me and Ketavan Tezzeritelli, the lead AI editorial engineer at Bloomberg. And I got the chance to talk all about this with her at one of my company's events. And essentially, the AIs are trained on thousands and thousands of past articles published by Bloomberg. So they learn the style of stories to report on, the style of tone and voice, and then they scan the market for news and information, write a story on it, and send it to the editors for a review. I read Bloomberg every day, and I've never been able to point out a story that seems more automated or AI-like. The AI is really, really good. And as I talk about all the time, AI is going to impact 100% of jobs, including journalism and writing. Take GPT-3, one of the most advanced AI language models on the planet. From social media captions, to script writing, to reporting, AI is going to play a really big role in the future of writing more broadly. Of course, there's something irreplaceable about a human perspective in something like journalism, but AI will also have a role. I'll continue to talk more about this.
