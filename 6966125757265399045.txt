Comfy triple feature it is. I don't know if this is going to be as comfy for you as it is for me But just go with it, and maybe you'll like it. Brave Bucks has comfy request of koi fish. I believe Dr. ChespiHD had also asked for koi, but I dropped my comet catch. This request has water, comfy animal, ray tracing, comfy factor maxed out, needs to be nerfed on next update. I have a very simple definition for comfy, by the way. It's similar to my definition of cursed, but I'm not going to give away yet. Let's see if someone can figure it out. I couldn't get the fish to properly show up here, but the output looks pretty for me. I will need a lot of assistance from you to get the koi fish to work. Please give me some input in the comments.
