We are making Minecraft real 59 second run let's go no time to explain just work with me here. We just spawned nearby punched a tree made a boat and we are on our way. For this run I changed fov to 90 and turned clouds off that all came from the last run. Since studious has been giving out cracked seeds like hot cakes. Looser says a bob sent me the one here. GG's for that. I will put it in the comments. Anyway, I'm wasting time on this slow boat like a casual but the elders have a strat. This seed has a bunch of biomes next to each other. We punch a tree in the jungle make a boat and then go to ice spikes which have a p blue ice. Boat plus blue as means buffed as fuck travel. I'm trying to get to the jungle but seems like a big L is what I'll get. This still looks like shit but I'm telling you don't worry about it. Technoblade is my speech coach. I got this. Screen cap the edgelords saying it won't work so they get documented in 4k when this is done. Feed me your seeds and runs. Let's fucking get it. Easy.
