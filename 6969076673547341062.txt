A PS Fuck Power duet that will kick my music generator into high gear by Powerhouse users Cam and Lucy Fine. Try another illustration style generation. Usertobi requests Dietrich's Potter style foxes in a flower garden. Hopefully this style is very different from anime. That way we can test if we can resemble multiple illustration styles. Usertobi sent me a few examples. Most wear in black and white. I will first try generating something with this style. Not really trying to make any object-first random shapes. Then I try with this. Hey Codex, you paint us like our dreams. Let's generate a world together filled with positivity. Hey Codex, you see the things we see. In advanced technicolor, stitch them back to us with glee. Don't worry Codex, we'll be careful with your trust. Your computer parts may rust, but your data just like us. Hey Codex, let's learn the world together.
