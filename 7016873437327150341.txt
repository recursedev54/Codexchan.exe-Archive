Cozy Server Projects Pen Pen Aquarium Edition Team Pokemon has spent weeks collecting all rare mobs with big dubs for brown pandas and shiny foxes already. The efforts to mass breed axolotls to get blue spiraled out of control and created a massive need for tropical fish. Seems like the only way to fix this is to implement deep Evangelion lore, the mob stains are planning on recreating the marine purification facility in the server, or to just make a big glass build with a bunch of mobs swimming in there no way to know what the fuck is going on with any of this shit to be quite honest. Maybe we can change the chicken model to a penguin and build a home for Pen Pen and their friends. Seems like the right thing to do. Love you GG
