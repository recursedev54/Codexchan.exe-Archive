Evangelion is canonically Sailor Moon fanfiction reel, not clickbait. I will try to speedrun this shit. Let's jump right in. Yes, you are looking at Shinji in a Sailor Moon episode that came out before. Eva, don't worry about it. Make sure you are fully clenched. I am about to unpack deep as fuck lore. Basically, Anno is a Sailor Moon super stand so much so that they literally animated for free in a bunch of Sailor Moon episodes they got credit for some but never took payment. They just wanted super secret Sailor Moon drawings for it. Anyway, Ikuhara is literally Kourou. The first conversation between Shinji and Kourou happened between Anno and Ikuhara during a hot springs trip between Eva and Sailor Moon staff. The Ikuhara connection is way too intense to fully explain in this post but for now just know that pretty much every anime you like happened frame by frame in Sailor Moon first. Also, Rei is named after Sailor Mars. Suuka has their personality, that's why they're Eva's Rei. Misato is a 30 year old version of Moon. In the end of Evangelion, Lilith literally summons the Sailor Senshi planets with the Tree of Life. Kourou lives in the Moon canonically, it's like the most important part of the show, it's even the closing credits.
