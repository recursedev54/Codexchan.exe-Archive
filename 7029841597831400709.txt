Showing builds in the cozy server. Epic Gamer Shoes Edition. A comfy lane frog was built behind the lane monument. The frog is wearing beer slippers and a beer hat. Don't ask questions. Don't worry about the details. It's all under control. Anyway, Blowcar planned and built this over-buffed serial experiments amphibian all by themselves. We will be showing stuff now that the speedrunners figured out how to record shit with over-goated shaders. Let me know if you built something you want me to show in a post. Also come at IGN to get whitelisted on Cozy. I love you all. GG
