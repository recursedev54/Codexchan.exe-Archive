Use your last train to Transcentral Watts to see a volcano. We just did Fairy, Crazy, Mirror, Mermaid, Madoka, Lane, Meth, Raucous, Input, and finally Meme Da Vinci drawings. Chances of this thing looking even close to realistic are not great, Chief. Some lava labels, but my color histograms are spiky. Output looks like someone drew this using Skittles. Some maybe-realistic smoke, but not really. We should try to generate something realistic looking at some point, or we might end up stuck in Meme Land.
