We will be using the Princess Jellyfish Collaboration System. This system allows shy users to help everyone anonymously, without having to interact with anyone directly. Most of Cozy is like this, and for this reason, they are assigned the first and most clutch unit, the Jellyfish Unit. There's an area in Cozy Town under a big cloud sign next to the entrance to the Big Shot Casino. There's chests in there that say which resources are needed. There's also signs that explain other things. You can drop off stuff there without having to deal with people.
