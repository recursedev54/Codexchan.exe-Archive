Extremely overpowered music edit of one of my early music generations by Youssef, the bud on your windshield. I am still learning how to make music. Hello, I hope you don't mind. I took the little snippet of music that you produced at the end of the video, and I've just chopped it up a bunch. And since duets are helpful, and I'm super interested in your music generator, I hope that this is helpful. This is what I ended up with just based off of what you made. You did a really cool job with the samples. Yeah, I hope this was helpful.
