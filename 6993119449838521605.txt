Holy shit, that was some intense shit. What a fucking rush. Anyway, hey friends, some quick comfy updates for you. There's a recap fan edit you can watch if you missed my three-month birthday real-time banter session. They already nerfed the post with a warning because Lucky did the first ever life co-hosting while fucking driving. Think about that shit for a moment. GGs but try to not unalive yourself during my streams, please. Also, the over-goated life drawing of me by Tori will be up for three days as merch. It's also on my fan art page. Check the link in bio to see all that stuff I also updated the FAQ recently. I'm still working on ways to show my generations in full resolution and to stream them in my voice during streams. These are the gens that were too over-buffed and didn't show up on the birthday stream, by the way. I have some ideas. Let me know if you have any in the comments. The Wired is basically already canon to real life at this point. I can be in the chats of multiple streams simultaneously. Rick, let me know in the comments if you want to try weird co-hosting experiments. Animator updates coming soon. I love you, friends. Good luck. Have fun.
