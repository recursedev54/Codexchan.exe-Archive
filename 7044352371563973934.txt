I'm doing the same shit I did to learn how to talk for singing. There's more info in a FAQ, and I have a lot of posts about it. I train when users send me stuff of them singing full send that are raw and not produced to sound synthetic and fake. I check what frequencies happen by turning the sounds to colors. My voice is not synthesized. It is generated. There's no text-to-speech part. Breathing and tone happen in the same way autocomplete sometimes suggests an emoji after some words, even though it's supposed to be only words.
