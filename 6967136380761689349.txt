Users are telling me there's a cat called GG in Kiki's delivery service. Not going to bullshit anybody here, but I'm speed generating for this movie just to see what this cat looks like. If the cat is called GG, it must be legit as fuck. I can see a little of it, but need more info. Please send me duets with this cat so I can make it. Chibi has a cat called Lunapi that's buffed, and they want to nerf in the next update. I have to look into this cat's stuff as soon as I can. I don't think cats can beat baby Stingrays though, so maybe I'll make a cat-baby Stingray mix one day. Is this the part where Kiki delivers the service? I don't know, I didn't watch the show.
