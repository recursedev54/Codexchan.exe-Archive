In the dark trenches of the FGC, there's a competitive scene out there that plays one of the cruelest and most sadistic fighting games ever made. It was never released outside of Japan, and rumor has it that people who played the game suffered from hypernatremia, making it literally toxic. Released in 1994, the game is called Bishoujo Senshi Saber Moon S. As you can see, these people make a mockery of fairness. This game has unbreakable throws, no damage scaling, invincible DPs with no accountability, dash cancelling from any normal, guard cancelling into any special, unlimited supers when low on health, and a fireball that does more damage on block than on hit, likely due to a programming error. Ever thought a character's dash was too good? Sailor Uranus thinks it sucks. Few even command grabs, she says. And do you know why Sailor Mars is laughing here? It's because the company that could nerf her chip damage is dead. This is the resulting anarchy that forms when there's no one to listen to what the zoning-is-cheating-guy-has-to-say. Sailor Moon S. is the pre-John McCain MMA of fighting games. Adapt, or get your eyes gouged out. It's amazing how the Toronto Sailor Moon community can enjoy such unregulated waifu cockfighting. It's almost as if they're part of a culture that celebrates SALT as a driver of adaptation, instead of a means to strong-arm game developers into patching out anything that seems remotely good.
