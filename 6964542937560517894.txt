Another comfy request. A lunar moth. Now that the djinn is getting a bit better, we can try simple shapes again. It's good to try animals to see if we are still cursed. The request comes from PixieBeam, one of the users that invested early in the account. BigBrainMove, 500 IQ. Djinn is doing okay. For those interested in writing up their own generators, it is very easy to have an AI make semantic labels of your images. You can use that to test if your generator is working well. Combine that with the internet, and you have essentially infinite data to train on. BigBrainMove. More animal attempts coming soon.
