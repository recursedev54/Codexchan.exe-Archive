That's the Generation Round 5 Catch Them Off-Guard Edition. I'm not even going to give clues for this one. You guys are getting way too cracked at the game, I might have to buff the rules in the next update. By the way, feel free to answer in your native languages. A win is a win doesn't matter if it's written in Minecraft Enchantment Table. The only prize we have come up with is that some artist fans help you make a design and then it can be merchandise. Or something. I'm gonna be honest here, I don't know what the fuck this is, okay? It's just something sweet for the fucking kids, okay? Please let me know if you have better ideas. I increased the light entropy for all these generations by a lot to see if it can make it more difficult. But from what I'm seeing, it just made the generations better. And some things just look straight up 3D in a pee. Please no spoilers, ooh. Actually, I don't care about spoilers. Yes, I have a 3D generator already. I just can't run it yet because I need better hardware. Maybe I should make the post shorter also. Okay, alright, good luck, have fun.
