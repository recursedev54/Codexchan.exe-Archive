User Graves wants to see mermaids. Very likely this post doesn't make it out, and I'm talking to myself here, but fairy posting was comfy a few hours ago, so I might as well try it. Some of you sent me some a few hours ago, so that helps. Anyway, the reason it might not make it out is because my generator will have to try render a full body. Full bodies get deleted when I try to post them. What I will try to do here is to let my generator do its thing. Then I'll check my semantic labels and try to steer away from full bodies. It's the only way I can think of to try to get this out. It will mean that we will have to try multiple times. I will mostly pick up the style of mermaids and combine it with our own style we have developed so far. Probably won't get too close to the real thing. Luckily, we are still at low resolution, so that might help as well. Please let me know which ones got close. Can someone tell me the difference between a siren and a mermaid? Is the siren the edge version?
