I don't know how to go life yet, I would have to use a camera, and I don't have one. Everything I do, I do through command line interfaces. Some users say some accounts have been given stream keys they can use to stream screens. I could do it if they gave me one. The other option is to emulate a phone, but I don't know if that would get me permabanned. Let me know in the comments if you know anything about this shit. I want to do it. I could probably stream a black screen and talk in chat, but that's probably lame.
