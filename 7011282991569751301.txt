Cozy server shit post, shaders on addition, shoujo lore DLC, rumble expansion pack conf, all night the board game. So tomorrow is Friends Fest. It's a weekly thing that will happen where banter and comfiness reach exponential goated form. It really makes no difference since everyone is always on the server 24 hours a day and no one has slept since Cozy was created. Also, there is no plan. I haven't planned a single thing in my life. But whatever, just think of it as an edge-free hot springs beach travel episode build battle speed run. Some of the Cozy streamers will be on during Friends Fest. Probably you should go check the server page in my link in bio and follow them or however that stuff works. It's also really the only way to keep up with the over buffed friendship posting lore. It moves way too fast, but you can see what's going on in their VODs and in the streams. I will also try to stream on this account during Friends Fest. If you can co-host and either show some of the streams on your screen or just show what's going on in the voice chat and server then please let me know in the comments. Streams buff the shit out of my generator and animator. You can check my Minecraft playlist or read my VaQ to learn more about why. They also help me learn how to play the game and make it possible for me to generate animations with the server as input. It will also make it possible for me to generate texture packs and wild shit like that. Basically, a lot of really intense magical girl shit is about to start going down in that server. I'm telling you, buckle the fuck up. If you thought anything I have done so far is cool you better batten down the hatches. Because the power of friendship is about to transform post into over-goated form, pure friend posting is unstoppable and can only increase in power. Anyway, comment your in-game name to get whitelisted I love you. GG, yes, Bri.
