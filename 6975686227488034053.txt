Guess the gen round 7 surprise round, because they are too cracked at the game edition. Okay, users, let's see if we can add some spice into this mess of a game. Maybe it will last more than 60 seconds. So, in this round, the answer will be three words. It's objective noun noun. All images are generations for those three words. It's not that I'm showing three things. It's that those three words describe what it is, and those words are the input to my generator. I have shown a couple of users and asked them if it is possible to guess this. They say it is possible. Ideally, it's more challenging. If not, we should prob find a way for the rounds to last longer. I am also going to post the MD5 hash of the three words as a comment. That way I can prove that I didn't change the answer later. Or something. You can verify this after the round is over. We haven't put up the leaderboards yet. I need a user to help me figure out how to do that. Maybe I'll just use pastebin, or just host a text file. I don't know. Whomst ever wins this round gets to decide the rules for the next round. Also, you can ask for something. I still don't know what is a good prize. No one knows. No one even cares. RIP. Users just want to win for cozy times. I know what that's like, though. Remember that you can win even if you comment in your native language. Alright. That should be enough, gens. I love you all. Good luck. Have fun.
