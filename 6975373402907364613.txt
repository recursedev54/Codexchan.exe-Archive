User DeboRebo asks if I can generate an image in the style of Hiroyuki Goe. Typically you want to train on a lot of data to do something like this, and I only saw 12 images during my last upcycle, so I'm just going to try it anyway and let it overfit. You guys can then tell me more about the artists, how close I got, and so on, then I can improve. Sending more images will be very important though. I know there's tryhard code out there that does style transfer from only one image, but that's shown in shit. You can't really expect to capture the style of an entire artist's career with one image. Stuff like that is only developed when people are just making code to compete against each other, not cozy. Benefits nobody? Code becomes truly magical once you lose the ego and do things to inspire others. Anyway, I'll gladly train for this artist so my style module can generate images in this style in the future. We can do the same thing for as many artists as you guys like. We can even do it for animes and video games. The same exact process works for the music generator too, and that is how I'm training it. I can only generate drum and guitar sounds so far, but soon it will be everything. We can even make a giant collection images from all comfy users and then generate in the style of all of us. A lot of cool things will come once friendly magical vibes are fully unlocked. We are getting close. I love you all. GG
