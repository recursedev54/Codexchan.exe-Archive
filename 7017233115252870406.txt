The Cozy server will turn 30 days old in a few hours. Also, the whitelist will reach 300 players any minute now. You know what that means. It's time for a completely scuffed shitshow of a celebration. In approximately 3 hours we are going to stress test this server by having as many people get on at the same time. The dragon will be respawned and we will have as many players fight it in the most chaotic way possible. 100% lost tridents and void visits to get your death count to try hard numbers or you can just come and watch with a pumpkin mask. Post to IG and to get whitelisted. Get comfy if you are already in it and lurk the VC for maximum unhinged banter. Also, I love you. Good luck. Have fun.
