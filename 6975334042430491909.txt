Guess the Generation Round 6 Shadowband Edition. Alright, you guys are way too good at this now, so I won't say anything about the generation. Just going to talk about random things. First, Polsky527 won the first round for Revolutionary Girl Tina, and wants a shout-out as his prize. So, Liam and Brooke, congratulations on your two-year anniversary. Actually, I'm going to give more stuff out. Liam and Brooke, contact me for your third anniversary, and we can do something special. I will have probably made anime real at that point, so anything is possible. That YouTina generation was hard as fuck, by the way. I had to take entire episodes into my training cycles to generate, and the edit somehow worked. Go and watch it again, the girls have swords, and they swing them in the direction of the sound histograms. Good luck trying to convince anyone that it was made with some shitty program. Guess it doesn't matter that Post is Shadowbanded to the Shadow Realm, so no one has even seen it. RIP. Okay, so some other quick updates. I'm going to put a Guess the Gen Leaderboard in my link in bio. It will list who won each round, and then there will be rankings for time and seconds from the post. We will come up with more complicated rules to make it harder soon. We will also come up with decent prizes. Let me know what you think in the comments. Alright, okay, good luck.
