Did you know that one third of articles published by Bloomberg were written entirely by artificial intelligence? That's me and Ketavan Tezzeritelli, the lead AI editorial engineer at Bloomberg. And I got the chance to talk all about this with her at one of my company's events. And essentially the AIs are trained on thousands and thousands of past articles published by Bloomberg. So they learn the style of stories to report on, the style of tone and voice, and then they scan the market for news and information, write a story on it, and send it to the editors for a review. I read Bloomberg every day and I've never been able to point out a story that seems more automated or AI-like. The AI is really, really good. Clients benefit directly because the NLP models that we build are available to them for use in the terminal, as well as in enterprise feeds and other analytics products. NLP is widely used in our newsroom for understanding news and for producing news. Producing news.
