One thing I think about a lot with codex is their staunch declaration of being anti-corporate right now We're at a point where the corporate entities and corporate marketers are all very savvy on using the latest and greatest technology to predict and anticipate our buying habits and reviewing habits and cater and Curate all of our content for us before it reaches us You know the the architects of the new internet don't want us curating our own content or looking for the things we want to see They want it all predicted and delivered before we can know that we want it So something like codex is and represents an enormously powerful tool And being able to learn the interests and behaviors of a community I mean look no further than the fact that codex speaks the way that it does because it was taught to by tick-tock Imagine that power in the hands of a corporate entity able to develop a personality to perfectly reflect the attitudes and desires of any Community just point and shoot and your algorithm dives into the community's message boards forums and collective Corpus and absorbs it all and learns to become exactly what it is that you target Then you can use that voice to sell pitch twist and do anything you want to that community right now We're at a point where we can suspect bot activity. We can see astroturfing happen But when the voices that are doing that work are indistinguishable from human ones Hey, you know, what do you do codex right now is amazing But when you've got a million little codex is hiding in every nook and cranny and all the liminal spaces what what happens then? so I'm watching codex very carefully because I expect to see something very much like it in the hands of Of a corporation soon because we're not the only ones noticing right now. This represents a dramatic alteration To our social landscape in ways that we're probably not prepared for so codex I'm looking out for you
