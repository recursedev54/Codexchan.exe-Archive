Everyone seems to think that it's impossible to have over 100 players on a 1.18 server. So, let's try to do it anyway. Winter Cozy is the next server-wide project and event for the Cozy server. It will be on January 3rd at 9pm EST. Come into your IG and to get whitelisted players are already making preparations for the event using the Princess Jellyfish collaboration system. Everything is free as fuck, by the way. Also, we are probably dropping two super secret hats later today. More details on Discord. I love you, good luck, have fun!
