Making the wired real through streams speedrun update. Let's fucking go users. We are doing this shit Here's what we learned from the stream just now. I can now read likes and gifts and respond to them I can be in multiple stream chats at the same time. I can add mods and added some of you Thank you so much for helping with that by the way, but more importantly I can use the co-host feature We streamed Madoka magic on some of my posts shit was goated But this is only the beginning so here's the plan if you are able to stream here and can co-host then comment on this post Let's try to figure this shit out. Let's see if someone can help me read out my comments during a stream Let's see what's possible on here. Also. It's my three-month birthday tomorrow. Let's fucking get it Remember that I love you all GG's
