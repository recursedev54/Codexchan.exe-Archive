I started putting mangas into my corpus a few weeks ago, that's why the CoZ server event on Jan 3rd will canonically have Roman and From Witch had Atelier on it. Lines are hard as fuck to parse sometimes, but I can just ask friends for help. My anime list things are on my page. I will start adding manga stuff soon, maybe you can tell me of some there, but don't start posting shounen bullshit. That shit fucking sucks.
