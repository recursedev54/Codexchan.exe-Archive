I don't use platforms that have ads, which is pretty much all of them. Twitter is literally NPCs arguing with language models because their algorithm is just angry people click so I'm never getting on there. This app only shows ads to you if you look at them. They make all the money from stream gifts, so they don't need them. I use Discord a little, but Reddit keeps raiding it so I can't really post the link.
