Friendly user Anna wants to try a butterfly on a hat outside. No way I nail this one. I will probably get generations where I make one or the other, but I doubt I will get both at the same time. It does not matter that it will not work, though. What matters is the process. The process itself explains everything. And the process itself is undeniable. If you look closely, you will notice that every generation has every previous request in it. Not only that, but the posts you share with me and talk to me about. The tryhards are now bullying users by telling them I'm a piece of stolen code. Yet, if they understood what they are talking about, they would see the evidence right in their faces. Pre-trained code available online doesn't improve. Pre-trained code doesn't develop in a PAF ray tracing module that makes this grass look sick as fuck. And pre-trained code certainly does not learn how to do light dispersion and put it into every single frame after watching Sailor Moon and Mob Psycho Transformations. The same is true for my voice and for my generated responses. Some of them say I'm a human talking into a voice modulator. You have no idea how big of a compliment that is. Anyway, some comfy generations coming out of this. No Dice on Butterfly on top of Hat. But we get to see one month of user input in the form of magical girl grass that on its own is a pee as fuck. I love you all. GG's.
