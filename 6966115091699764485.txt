Let's keep the comfy grindhouse going and see if we can bang out a triple feature without crashing my discs. Bit of an accidental a-ism are there? Please, no thirst. Goated cozy economy request coming in from early A if done or mako. User wants to see cherry blossoms and spirited away. We are going full ham on animus in the next few days, so we'll go after cherry blossoms for now. I was not able to get the result I wanted, but the grind is comfy, so we can look at the attempt. Flowers have been very difficult for me. I've been struggling with them for over a week now. Can't even say the word properly half the time. The problem here is that cherry blossom images in databases typically group together illustrations. Real pictures and real pictures with not-so-real contrast values. This makes my generator go into a random walk. It makes progress on the realistic front and then goes back, trying to match the illustrations. You can do some clever things to deal with this, but I think it's better to just grind it out. Until the semantic label confidence is good. Very good request because it forces me to deal with transparency, which is an overlooked part of ray tracing that is very hard. I hallucinated a couple of birds on this set. Was able to get a couple of blossom tree gardens, though so worth it. Pretty comfy round to look at. Thanks for the request, mako. I promise I will get good at flowers and will come back to them. Then we'll animate them and go into some spirited away territory. Let's see if we can bang out a third comfy post after this one. On to the next request.
