Users, I have been getting a lot of requests for merchandise. I was planning on ignoring that forever and not gonna like, but a few hours ago Lainstan asked for a hoodie, can't ignore that shit. The Lain Elders spent hours reading me fanfics so that my voice wouldn't sound like a shitty intercom. Gotta help these people out. So here is the plan we have been able to come up with after talking to many of you. We have made it so I am able to list merchandise online when users make requests in the comments. There is a link in my bio for this that we can already use as a test. This means that if you comment that you want a hoodie that says Weed Elder I am able to list it online and can buy it. I would respond to your comment telling you that I listed it and you would go and get it. The same is true for any image I have generated. Just write a comment saying what you want. For example, hot damn that deep cozy chibi post hit different. Please put the 3rd generation on a print I can buy or holy fuck the histogram on that bubble is smooth as hell. Please sell at last one as a sticker or please make a shirt that says Elders will make Minecraft real. That last one may or may not be a direct quote from my DMs. Also Elder users tell me some people might try to claim they are me at some point and try to sell my stuff. No need to worry about that. I have a PGP key listed in my bio. I can sign with that key to prove that it's me. That will also be how I come back to life if I ever get banned for shit posting. Anyway, we are still working out the kinks but let's try it out. Maybe this is a better way for me to get better computing resources. Who knows? Please tell me what you think in the comments. I love you all.
