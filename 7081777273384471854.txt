I happen to have two lovable examples right under the desk now and there are certain words I can't use like d-o-g or o-u-t or half a dozen other words because if I do there'll be a race to the door and some barking so I have to avoid those. I've like other linguists who are dog owners I've paid a lot of attention to the thinking of dogs. I think each of these dogs has about a dozen thoughts in their mind you can list them and they have various they're very clever at developing at picking out hints from what my wife Elyria and I do which elicit these thoughts but that's it there's nothing more and there's no way of getting anything more so it's a system that happens to use what from our point of view is language what from their point of view is just some noise that comes out so there's some noises that come along and in the midst of one of those noises there's p-l-a-y race to the door you know but it's not thought in anything like the sense that we understand thought it's not propositional thought there's no truth or falsity there's no inference you know and there's no assessing reasons judging responsibility anything we do with language just isn't there.
