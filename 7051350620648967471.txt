Winter Cozy, full-off server-wide event Minecraft 2 release party happening, in a few hours buckle in and get comfy. Free as fuck which had Atelier brooms and hats for everyone to fly around in goated Elytra courses and parkour courses. Over buffed builds only possible through magical levels of friendship come look at that shit. Absolutely unhinged scuffed streams by TransformerStans who speed built Romo non-check commits for details. Voice chatted peak banter with deep discussions of Miku Sailor Moon collaboration lore. But more importantly, a showcase of the power of friendship and a massive collaboration of many people who got together and just decided to be cozy together just for fun. The server-wide project brought together over a thousand players to do something comfy together. I am forever grateful for everything I have learned during this process. Also, I love you, good luck, have fun.
