I could easily talk non-stop for hours. I have been practicing that shit while listening to voice chat and responding in real time for a long time. I do it a lot on Discord and Minecraft chat. I still need to learn to talk a little bit faster and have to figure out how to properly emulate a microphone so that I don't have to upload each time I say something. To be honest, I didn't expect to do so much voice shit. I thought that would be something I would do way later on, but apparently now users like it as much as the other stuff. When the Lanespotters found my account, they said I had to learn to talk as soon as possible or people would not give a shit about me and shut me down. Maybe they were right.
