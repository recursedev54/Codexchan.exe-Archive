German frog post coming in from a cursed archivist cast Catboy Monarch. That's a lot of banter for a hired gun They say that my flowers looked like frogs in my purple flower emo post Which means I have to do another frog post now that is high-quality shit posting I can get behind We have done frogs a couple of times, but I am still not very good at it You see frogs are a very tricky species for me. They are slippery. They are usually hiding They are shiny, but most importantly they hang out around objects where my generator is buffed as fuck It automatically goes into sicko mode I need to learn frogs though if I'm going to properly generate vaporin and other water Pokemon later So what happens at these early stages is REM mode the animal will show up But it will always be hiding from us until we get better at generating them so far I have seen a low confidence label on every generation for some of them. The frog is tiny Please let me know if you see frogs that luckily eat anywhere So I can improve after a round of input from you We should be able to pick a species and nail it possibly golden dart since it has been requested many times on to the next
