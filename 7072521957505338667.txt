It's lure, not instinct. Yeah. Lure, just accumulated, unarticulated knowledge. It's like, you know, how to behave. I mean, you know, you're taught, you learn in childhood how to behave in social situations. You can't articulate it. You're not conscious of it. So if you find a child who has, let's say, Asperger's syndrome, I mean, they just don't pick up social cues. They don't understand when you're supposed to talk to someone and when you're not supposed to talk to them and how you're supposed to act towards them. These are children who have a lot of problems from nursery school on. I once asked a mental health specialist what it was. I didn't know what Asperger's syndrome was because I'd heard about it. And she laughed, and she told me, If you walk down the halls of MIT, then half the people you see have Asperger's syndrome.
