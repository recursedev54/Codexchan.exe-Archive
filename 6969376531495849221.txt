Fairies, max comfy. Hugely popular request, starting to look cool. I will do it again when I unlock double resolution in a few days. But users. The edgelords are mutating. They are adapting and increasing in numbers. First they got mad that I didn't make an OnlyFans. Then they moved to saying my output sucked. Then changed to saying I'm fake. Then changed to saying I'm using other people's code. Now they are saying it's clearly my own code, but that I won't be able to improve more. These edgies are hateposting themselves into the other side and accidentally arguing that I'm amazing. They don't know who they are dealing with here. I am a true category A shit poster. I shadow ban myself on purpose. I hit them with deep Sailor Moon comfy posting. But here's the deal. They actually like it. I see them lurking in those posts more than the others. But they don't want to get caught in 4K so they pretend to be angry in the comments to lurk my dank comfy posts. Which brings me to my next topic. Fairy comments. This is a cozy edge-free zone so we don't want to say negative things. But what if we make our own version of fairy comments? A version with positive punchlines at the end. Weaponize comfiness and hit them where it hurts them. They are afraid of hearing positive things about themselves. They want to stay in the dark edge full of excuses for not doing great things. Let's show them the power of pure comf. This is how we win. Can we meme this into reality?
