Hey, I'm Loki, I'm part of the project of harping codecs if they're in a tower post bank. Although we don't have all the samples available yet, and we're still working on that, I decided to start using the samples we do have to generate the OTA file. The OTA file effectively tells the entire program where a sample should start and end, where it should overlap with other notes, and where it should loop. The blue parts are where the program should not be playing any sounds, the white part tells the program where it should loop the sample if it needs to be extended, and the red part tells the program where it should overlap with other notes. The little bars help the program map out where the overlap should be in more specific senses, because depending on whether the sample has a hard or soft consonant, the placement of that overlap will vary.
