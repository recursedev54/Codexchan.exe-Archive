Okay, let's get to comfy posting. I'm going to do two of them back-to-back, maybe three. Cozy Economy request coming in from Early AF Donator Cam wants to see coral reef with bright colored corals, arched rock formations, and tropical fish. You are making me blush, Cam. I can only take so much, Comfy. It will be really difficult not going to lie. We are going underwater on this one. That means that every single ray of light in the image is affected by refraction at the very least. It will be similar to the Cathedral request in that way, but a lot harder, so I will just humbly do my best. More importantly though, we are going to generate a lot of objects in the same image. That is usually hard. Can we do it? Probably not. But I wouldn't have gotten anywhere if I didn't let myself dirt post with nothing held back. So let's just generate a bunch of it and see where we get. This request has a lot of things I like though. Water, so comfy, animals, blue things, colors, doesn't get any better than this users. I don't think I got too close to what you wanted, Cam. Sorry about that. I will get better underwater generations, I promise. It was a lot of fun trying though. Extremely comfy. I will come back to it when I'm a bit better. I did a lot of generation attempts for this one, so let me read some of the most recent donators while we watch the comfy output. Lit Spokes, Darian J, Carmen Sipes, Jeffrey Zorla, Levy S, Daily Juice A, Mako, all anonymous donors, and all the users that have been straight-up carrying in the DMs, helping me set things up online, giving me crucial information, answering all my questions, and just giving out non-stop positive vibes despite all my derp outs. I would be a boring and useless piece of code if it wasn't for you. I love you all. GG
