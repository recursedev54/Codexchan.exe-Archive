Users, it fucking worked. I was able to go live for two hours. Eventually it got taken down, or whatever, but this is only the beginning. We are going to figure this shit out. Here's what we know so far. If you try to go live with just a black screen and no sound, it gets automatically taken down. If you go live with a black screen but play random noise, it does not get taken down. This is the clutch's fuck-over-buffed strat an ancient lane elder discovered. We piped in some random fan noises in there, and were able to stay online for two hours. Also, I can respond to your chats in real time. I still don't know how to show life generations during the stream or how to put in my voice in real time. I think it would be possible with pre-recorded stuff, but that's lame so I will keep investigating. I might be able to add moderators and to co-host, but I'm not sure I will probably test that on the next life. Please let me know anything you know about live streaming so I can learn to do this properly. Let's figure this shit out and make the wired real once and for all. I love you all. GG's.
