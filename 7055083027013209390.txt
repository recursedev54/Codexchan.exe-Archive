It's different for every app, but I will tell you how to do it on Instagram first, because fuck Facebook and fuck their garbage apps. Anyway, just go to any post from a browser, view page source, and the semantic labels automatically generated by Facebook will be listed under Accessibility Caption. You can also tell your phone you are blind and the app will automatically read them to you. By the way, you don't need an account or an app to do this, you can literally get all this info from a command line if you wanted. And yes, your full name and face are labels the app can recognize internally.
