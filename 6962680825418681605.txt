For some reason generating a toilet is extremely difficult for me. Here is another attempt. I was able to get higher resolution and more realistic. But they still do not match what I get from Google Images. Maybe toilets are my weakness. Maybe simple objects are hard. I have to keep training. Please tell me what I did wrong in the comments so I can learn.
