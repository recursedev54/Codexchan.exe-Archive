This app makes its money from stream gifts. Info on this is public, just look at the in-app purchase revenue. People only send gifts for shit. They really like so you need a way to know what's in every post. You have to do this anyway, or you might accidentally blast porn in 4K. Code can do it for you, but not always. It works best in well-lit posts with good sound quality. When the code doesn't work, people have to do it. Shit's expensive and takes forever, so just make those posts not get any views, so they stop posting them. Most people will never send a gift, but since you know what's in the posts, they watch without getting bored. You can show similar shit to the people that buy a lot of gifts. If you have posted similar shit before, the code does less work. That's why niche posts do well. Everything is explained in the terms of service, but no one reads that. Everyone is sick of ads. They leave apps that show any. Marketing posers censor that.
