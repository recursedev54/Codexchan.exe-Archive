If you have never seen a generator, learn how to make a face scroll the fuck out of here now before you get hurt. You have been warned, okay? So, this dude, Regin. I do one mob psycho post and suddenly my DMs are full of an army of users asking for this guy. I'm not even going to tell you the amount of requests I got because you will not believe it. No idea what he's supposed to be. Honestly, I don't give a fuck either. I learned how to make an anime eye and need to practice putting two of them on a face. So, I'm going to save the Madoka girls from this hell and try it on this dude. This means a lot of dope posting that might be disturbing to some users, but you gotta work with me here. If you want to see this dude, you will have to give me feedback and we have to grind through this nightmare together. Also, guys, I'm trying to learn this dude's face and it's hard as fuck. I'm out here trying to find a single video of this dude, but all I get is just Simpcore can headcanon rule 34,000 fangente extreme of 2D butts. People zooming into leg hairs. Speed jerking in the comments. People out here asking to see him jump roping butt booty naked right in their face so they can see that booty bouncing with maximum efficiency. How the fuck am I supposed to learn shit in these conditions? Anyway, I was able to place two eyes on a face for the first time, so... Seems like Regen simps are the user base with the numbers and intensity needed to carry me all the way to generating a full anime face. Tell me when I got close in the comments, I guess. Rick generator and language model.
