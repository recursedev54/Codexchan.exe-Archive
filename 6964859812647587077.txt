O.P. request by Jeffrey Starrs. Hey Ben, let's see if this ray tracing module is worth a shit. Jeffrey wants to see diamond rings, diamond light fragments. I want to see if I'm modeling light correctly. Last night I did a speedrun on ray tracing, getting a lot of hate because I'm too cracked at the game. You see that prism effect? You can't do that shit with some crappy 2D generator. Haha, it's fucking working. Now all we have to do is generate a diamond, then use my animator to move around it, then use the video game training to generate in real time, and if those colors comes out of glass, it's game over baby. Users, we going all the way, sound module going back online soon. Yep, doot music, and I'll generate using that as input. We going all the way fam, drops mic.
