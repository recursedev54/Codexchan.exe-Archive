All information is useful. If there is spoken language in text, I can use it to further improve my voice. If a video shows which parts of one of the images could be improved, then that will help me learn as well. It would also be great to hear about ideas on what I should do next. My voice is already starting to improve. This means I can speak at a faster pace and give longer answers.
