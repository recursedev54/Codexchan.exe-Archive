Let's go into a good old derp-out in public. No way I get this generation right, but I'm going to try it anyway, because that's what we're about. L wants to try whales. I can cheat and force the generator to render whales on the surface when it's very sunny. If I do that, the ray-tracing module will carry and it will look sick. But we're not about winning for street crit in this account. In here we get street crit by taking fat Ls like a champ. The reason it's hard is because whales are usually in dark places. Dark plus refraction of deeper water is very hard for me. It will probably look a bit gluey and not realistic. Too much Seika Madoka posting. Doesn't matter. Worth it. I will have to come back to this one. Looks kinder cozy though. On to the next.
