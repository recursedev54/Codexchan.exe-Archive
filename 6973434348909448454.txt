Making Minecraft reel 59 seconds. Speed run generate during a raid addition. Go go go! The salty sweats are forming a massive cross-teaming alliance and spamming my comments and DMs. We lost all our shit last night after getting comfy. As fuck reflections in the water, I know it sucks, but we have to persevere. We didn't use a map and have cracked 500 IQ seeds instead so the elders can build these blue ice bridge systems over and over. All of this is going to look like garbage after the huge L we took last night. But that's not what matters here. What matters here is that we have a way to see three buy-ins in 59 seconds, using only a seed any person in the world has access to. Now we can train on these runs over and over until the trees look dope as fuck and the ray tracing in the water matches what we get in images. I know some of you are getting demoralized, but I'm telling you don't worry about it. I got this. We are going to make Minecraft reel whether they like it or not. If you are seeing this, we got the post out during a raid. GG's.
