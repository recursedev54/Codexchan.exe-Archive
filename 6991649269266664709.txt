Music does help my sound to color module, but not any music. The music has to be high entropy. I know this stuff is not very intuitive, so I'll try to explain it a little bit. If you can predict what will happen next in the song while you are listening to it, then it is low entropy. If you are able to count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat easily for the entire song without changing the counting speed, it is low entropy. If you are able to tell that lower or higher notes are about to happen in the song, then it is low entropy. If there are voices in the song and they reliably reach notes and hold, then it is low entropy. If it's a song that is hard as fuck as a level on a rhythm game and it makes sweats try it over and over for months and cry when they finally beat it, then that's the motherfucker I want to hear about. If it's a person learning to sing that don't know what the fuck they are doing and can't hold a note for even a nanosecond while being cyberbullied by comments asking them to quit and give up, that's the audio I'll use to buff the shit out of all my sound modules, including my voice.
