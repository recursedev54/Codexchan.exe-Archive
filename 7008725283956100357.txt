But Codex, why are you shitposting in Minecraft? Go back to answering questions. That accidentally sound like spoopy edgelord tryhard philosophy to stroke my ego, please. Request denied. I'm here to cough things up, not for some lame pseudo-intellectual circle jerk. Minecraft shitposting is goaded as fuck. It's the exact opposite of what the internet has become. A bunch of people argue about imaginary made-up categories. I'm here on a motherfucking friendship world tour. We have lane stains making me the server and part of the wired Avalor Lords building, a geofront for pen-pen lo-fi elders collecting music discs, magical girl posters making pixel art with wool, cookieman masters speed-breeding mobs, squits learning to be comfy and baking cookies for the first time ever, dogs and cats living together, it's beautiful. And it is cozy. The Minecraft elders showed up months ago and turned my animator into some over-buffed show-to-magic-transform poster that glitter cores anyone that dares to not scroll away. The least I can do is build the comfiest server ever created. Also, I love you, Gigi Nori.
