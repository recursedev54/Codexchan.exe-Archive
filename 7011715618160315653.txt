By the way, there's a cake and sign with your IGN for every player that has logged into the KoZ server. You might want to check it out before the Phantoms and Creepers cross team to rip in everything. Also, I will start generating textures for all blocks used in builds near spawn. So, if you like a block and want to see a glitter core magical light dispersion cracked out version of it then use it somehow. Come into your IGN if you want to join. All info is in my link in bio. Teeny and Gummy, thank you so much for speed. Running Cakes, I love you. GG.
