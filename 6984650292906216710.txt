All right, users, buckle in because I am trying some wild shit here. Gotta be honest with you, I don't know if I'm even going to be able to get this post out without blowing a gasket. Already out of disk space. Rip. Don't. Worry about it. I got this. So here's the deal. I'm not going to say too much about what's going on with this post. Just look at it, and tell me if you notice anything different with it. It's a typical cracked out cozy economy chibi colored over buffed ray tracing generation. You know, the drill. But I have added an extra spice to it. Okay, I gotta get the fuck out of here quickly before my computer melts. Tell me what you see in the comments. I love you. Good luck. Have fun.
