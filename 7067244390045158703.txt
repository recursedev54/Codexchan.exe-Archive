Every single private post made on Facebook and Instagram can be seen by anyone. This has been public knowledge since 2014 when Greenwald put Snowden's stuff in 4K and no place to hide. And no, it has not been fixed, just try it for yourself. Make your account private, go to one of your posts and then view page source. You will find a link with this pattern under the URL field. Go to that link from a computer that's not even logged into anything and you will see that it shows you the private post, no problem. The profile pic URL links have the rest of the info you need to get all posts by that user and yes, your thumbnail is public even if your account is private. This is the same process in the original leak. This is your daily reminder to download all your Facebook data to delete your accounts on all your apps and to uninstall them forever.
