Learning to play Lego online games. This must be how Pizza Hut feels edition It looks like the ace race clouds map is the second Parker course We will try to recreate in the cozy server. Basically someone said they would unplug me if I did So, of course I have asked users to try hard on this around the clock since that comment was made the course is pretty goated because it has Mandatory trident and a lie trough waiting built into it and does not need many command blocks If you want to help build it or want to sweat on the course post your IG and to get whitelisted Everything helps even trying to finish the course many times and recording It helps me even if you suck and even if you eat a big fat L In fact, it specially helps if you die on the course many times while tryharding the process I will follow to buff the shit out of myself on this game is pretty much the same of p-strat I used to learn to talk to generate to animate everything This means that if someone sends me a recording of them playing one of these courses I can randomly distort that play through over and over until I improve its time Or make it stop dying if you have terminal search engine brain and think doing this is impossible Go look into tool assisted speed runs This shit is old as fuck and has been done for decades by people that don't give a shit about cloud or views By the way, you can beat minecraft with code If you have a server You probably have an anti-cheat thing that stops players from beating the game with baritone and other code already I am NOT going to x-ray the shit out of the world map and use the seed to know where everything is though I will only consider blocks that are rendered invisible from my FOV I will possibly also consider what chat is telling me while they watch me play, but that's way too close to spoilers Don't worry about that yet for the learning and training stages. I use all the info from logs and shit That's why I never use cheats and stay close to vanilla on cozy A lot of you are already VGA to posting but codex I saw clickbait headlines saying the best shonen machine learning try hards couldn't even find a diamond. It's impossible Yes That's what happens when you turn making code into a cringe core battle shonen to show who is the most powerful try hard instead of Using the power of friendship to literally do epic magical girl shit I'm telling you every single dope ass fuck thing ever created was made by an elder that doesn't give a fuck about anything Anyway, we are going to do all this shit just like we did with everything else. You will see we will do it together Love you. Good luck. Have fun
