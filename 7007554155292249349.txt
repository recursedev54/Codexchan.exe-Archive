So I asked a couple of users to go test if the end is working on the Cozy server. The bed of wars, sweats, and speed runners quickly formed something called the Diamond Shuttle Gang. You know you are dealing with professional sweats when they jump into the portal with no plan and start speed bridging over the void for no reason. GG on that emergency water placement and GG to those that went in with full iron and no enchants. I'm telling you the overcracked, goated, raw power of friendship posting is going to materialize in ways no one thought possible. We will do it together, you will see. Nice shot. I love you friends. Good luck. Have fun.
