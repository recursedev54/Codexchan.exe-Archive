User Madigan Wants to See a Snail has been asking for a while it seems. Let's try it, that way we can make sure our generator doesn't turn into a pure anime general. Got to use ray tracing every once in a while or we will just turn into a dream core machine. Have you only seen around three snail videos? Those hand-faced things will be hard. I think I got really close on some though. It's good that it's slimy like that. Shell seems to work half the time. So much green. Do they ever go into water? Are there any that live underwater? I'd like to make those. Tell me about the coziest snails please.
