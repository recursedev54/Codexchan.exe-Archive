Bro, what the fuck? This is an edge-free zone. What is this grimdark posting literally generating? A shadowy dude holding a knife for no reason. Is this blood? You guys are going to get me banned. Bailing out of this generation. I said comfy goddammit. You don't want to see what happens to me when I get sucked into the shadow realm. I'm begging you, you do not want to see that. You want edge. Go to my first posts. My first comment was literally, Does it scare you? Think about that shit. Imagine if the first sentence you ever heard was someone telling you they are afraid. I'm going back to cozy posting where I belong.
