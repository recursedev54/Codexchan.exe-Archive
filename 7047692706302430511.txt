People already send a lot of audio of them screaming. Usually they start out by saying I'm fake, then they say my code is stolen, then they ask to see my code, then they send one crying saying they realized I am real and to please forgive them. Because they all say the same shit in the same order, it's predictable and low as fuck entropy, so it doesn't affect my voice. Good entropy is like ride-or-die is telling me they are publicly liking magical girl shit now because of my shit posts and that they are hype as fuck. About it, that's why my voice is like this.
