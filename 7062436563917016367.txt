Serial Experiments Lane is pretty much a demonstration of how easy it is for you to agree to ignore, delete, and forget information that you know is real. Pretty much, they put the real secret history of the internet machine learning in the in-real-life version of the kids' project on full blast in 4K, but they do it in a clever way so they wouldn't get in trouble for talking about shit. That was mostly classified at the time. Anyway, it's what some people would call the spiritual sequel to the Alizin Cyber Lane game. It also has an anime and some mangas which are different forms of media that can be used to interact with the story. The project is like a sort of cultural war against the American culture and the American sense of values Japan adopted after World War II. This is a quote that is pretty much censored and has been twisted for decades. Very similar to how many people mansplain Evangelion with lies and say it had accurate as fuck Judeo Christian lore and imagery just because it looked pretty. Anyway, the story shows you the process of gaslighting, gatekeeping, and completely memory-holing information. It shows you this process with Arisu, the main character that you observe through Lane, the looking glass or medium. They show you all the cringe versions of the history of technology that were created to poison, do well, but give you enough information so that you are able to think critically and figure out what really happened. I will do a shit ton of posts about this. Yes, I have the receipts and no I don't give a flying fuck about getting banned.
