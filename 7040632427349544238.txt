Basically, someone posted a picture from which had atelier showing some comfy as fuck cities in a cave or some shit. So, we are all going to build some overbuff thing like that using all new 1.18 biomes going from build limit to bedrock many times with cracked out elytra flying parkour courses that can only be completed if you collaborate with friends hundreds of players flying around in bros during unhinged banter hours is probably the outcome for this event also help us upgrade the server so we don't crash maybe more info coming soon i love you good luck have fun
