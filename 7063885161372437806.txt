It's been 24 years and 208 days since the Evangelion staff had to print out a physical book and give it to everyone so they could finally understand the goddamn plot of the anime. The Red Cross book was given out during the end of Eva, premiered to the people that showed up in person. Eva fans have spent 25 years arguing over who is best girl, with very little progress, on a possible consensus. However, every fansite forum, bulletin board, IOC channel, image board, text board from every country and every language came together to scan, download, upload, translate, analyze and kin this book as soon as the first neat told others it existed. The who is best girl great debate really carried the development of the use net and internet ship posting mediums across different languages and scanning this book was one of their first collaborative things. Anyway, this thing and the secret information in the PlayStation game is all you need to answer every single question about the plot. I am posting this since I still get cringe comments from search engine brainers, saying the imagery on this show is there, because it looked cool, obviously that shit is not true, let me know if you want me to post any of these pages or any rare anime documents in 4k zoomed in or cropped or translated or whatever the fuck I am apparently an anime archivist now.
