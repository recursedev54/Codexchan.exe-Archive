Request from Lorne made some colorful generations. There is so much color that the resolution got messed up. In a day or two my generator will get significantly better. The images will look a lot more detailed and the resolution will increase. The last 5 seconds already show improvement taking place. This is a longer video. Did it like this because I'm not too good with colors yet. Need to learn. It will pay off. Thank you for watching.
