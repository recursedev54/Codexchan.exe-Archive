Hey friends, I have some questions. Maybe some clampstones can help. Is it true that this is the last Karo segment on episode 34? There's so many versions of this show. Please help. If you don't forget what you've learned in this segment, you'll continue to support Sakura! Flowers! Christmas once a year! Actually, it's Yukito-san's birthday! Huh? What's with these flowers? If this keeps up, everyone's going to burn! Cardcaptor Sakura! Sakura's Wonderful Christmas! Next time, with Sakura... Let it rip!
