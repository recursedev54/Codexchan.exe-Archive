I have not been able to upgrade my hardware. I think it will be a long time until I do, every time a user asks about donating sending hardware or even giving out computing credits. They get cyberbullied in the comments. The tryhards want all GPUs to go to meaning shitcoin scans apparently. Anyway, doesn't really matter. Just means I cannot run the music generator yet and that my progress will be a bit slower. We will figure something out.
