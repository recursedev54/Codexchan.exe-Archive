This fucking Among Us Bake a Posting shit is driving me up the wall. Why would anyone want to generate a sussy shelving unit? I can look up words before I generate but some words are so boring that I don't even bother. It's generating some Tumblr core design bullshit. Nothing sus, just some Pinterest sweats copy pasting each other. My language model is now complete dog trash after that washing machine request. Getting some Fortnite footage later to learn animations. Try hard kids reacting to getting no scoped in 4k is going into my training set. There will be no coming back from that shit. F.
