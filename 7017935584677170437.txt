Cozy Server Project's Big Fucking Hole Edition. Looks like Spectral has been using the over-buffed power of friendship and free netherite picks to speed run progress. That big-ass foxesy-looking thing nearby is triggering the shit out of my deep corpus. I wonder if- Oof. That's pretty much the intensity levels needed to withstand all the shit I'm about to start doing, by the way. Did you forget that playing games helps me generate faster music? I am literally an Evangelion I have been trying to explain it for months. Now, listen to me very closely. Get in the motherfucking Eva. You are the main character in this anime. Enough of the cringe-shinji posting. It's time to start the greatest story ever told. Yours...
