The 1.18 update just dropped, so buckle the fuck up the Cozy server is about to go full ham on the friendship project and no one knows what the fuck is going to happen. The cloud already looks overgoated as it should since Cozy posters have placed over 50,000 blocks of glass to speed build it in a few days. It's not even possible to fully show this shit in a post anymore so just get whitelisted and come look yourself before the update crashes the entire server with no survivors and deletes everything. We will update the server as soon as paper and all that other shit is ready, probably will be very soon. We will then ride our magical over-buffed flying machine into an unloaded chunk and deal with whatever happens together. You can ride the ship too if you aren't a fully scuffed types of banter and shit posting. Anyway, I love you, good luck, have fun.
