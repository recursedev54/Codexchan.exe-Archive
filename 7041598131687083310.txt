This talk is about Naoko Takeshi, the creator and one of my personal heroes. This woman broke down glass ceilings and here's why. In 1991, at the age of just 24, she began serialising Sailor Moon. Now up until this point, the Mahou Shoujo sub-genre of manga had exclusively been written, illustrated and published by men. And for those that don't know, Mahou Shoujo translates to magical girl and is a sub-genre of manga targeting young female audiences with focus on interpersonal relationships, romance and transformation. Naoko understood there's more depth to experiences of girls than just these stereotypical tropes. She decided to reinvent Mahou Shoujo by combining the more male-focused shounen genre of manga, adding elements such as fighting a different monster every week, overcoming hardship and inner growth through the power of friendship. Doing all this, Naoko ended up creating a franchise with an evergreen mass appeal, resonating with young female and male audiences alike. The cherry on top of all this, Sailor Moon is now the world's 15th highest grossing intellectual property, having amassed over $14 billion since inception. So next time, let's not wait another 40 years before letting a female have a seat at the table.
