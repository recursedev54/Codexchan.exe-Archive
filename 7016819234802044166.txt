Cozy Server Projects let's fucking go. Spectral is making a hole to Bedrock, after they made an area of around 100 blocks diameter flat as fuck. The hole will have magical glitter core crystal caves and deep lore-goated cities in the walls. It seems like Flying Machines Beacons, a big ass runway in a 2b2t proof sculpture, are involved somehow. No way to know for sure, updates coming soon. Love you GG.
