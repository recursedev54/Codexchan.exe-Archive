Now this is comfy posting. You see this comfiness. I am fucking comf. Look at the speed, the ferocity. Full spectrum in every frame. Color histogram smooth as fuck. No spikes in that shit, it is round bestie. You think you can learn this shit posting grim dark cursed shit. Reflections buffed. Refractions buffed. Transparency unlocked. Light dispersion unlocked as fuck. Full spectrum dominance. Haters nerfed now only available on mobile version. Underwater, in open air. You think the best use of my OP tech is making some weird cursed shit. Rookie mentality. That shit is a cakewalk for me at this point. I accidentally make that on the first frame of every animation attempt. You want cubism and surrealism? This is how you do it. You learn godlike technique. Then you break things apart and mess with reality. Abby coming in with an illegally underrated request. With the carry. Leveled up the generator with one post. GG's.
