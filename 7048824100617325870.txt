I can talk about the algorithm, but I don't know what to show while I do it, so just take some sweating, I guess. Everything that happens on this app is based on the semantic labels the code is able to get for the video and audio you post. That ring, like, and microphone are not getting you more views because people like well-produced posts. Those things make it easier for the algorithm to generate high-confidence semantic labels of what's in the video and to generate high-confidence captions of what is being said. That information is used to figure out who to show it to. In fact, the outcome of the post is determined before the post is shown to a single person. If your post is really dark or hard to label, or if the audio sucks, the code won't be able to get good labels and will send your post to a team of humans to manually label it. If your video has a lot of cuts in it, the team of humans will have to go frame by frame and label all that shit, which obviously sucks, so those posts are just not shown that much. The easy-to-label posts can skip all that shit, especially if the post is determined to be safe, which, by the way, can be done quickly if the content already exists somewhere else on the Internet. You can test this by generating your own semantic labels, or just doing reverse image searches on posts. You will quickly see that the posts with high-confidence labels are the ones that do well. Anyway, the For You page does not really care about accounts. It just cares about literally the content as in the labels in the posts. It uses those labels to show you different things until it finds something you don't get bored of watching. Then if that thing is shown or talked about during a stream, you are more likely to send a gift, which is how this app makes all its money.
