Sailor Moon is like Haiki since Sword, the shit on streaming sites, has nerfed the translations or fucked up and it's easy as fuck to gaslight yourself into believing the lies about it. You can start with episode 36 of Sailor Moon S. That shit will pretty much delete all misconceptions you have instantly and show you some intensity that might get you to watch everything else's prequels to understand the lore. Also, fuck streaming sites for nerfing the show and fuck a copyright watch it on Animesuge or something. A lot of the shit on this episode ended up in Evangelion like the Gendu glasses. I'll explain later. I love you. Good luck. Have fun.
