Okay, trying to generate pretty comfy things the sequel. Cash Money Pimp wants me to try to make a beautiful floating Island with butterflies. Sound legit? It looks pretty. There's butterflies everywhere, but you will notice there's not a single drop of water here. I think the thirst I'm getting in the DMs dried it all. What happened to the Island part? Dead is what happened. Generator did not care about it. The Island part is also strange. What is that thing in the middle? Did the generator make an Island of butterflies? I hope they re-alive, but doesn't look too good chief. For the record, no one asked for that thick bee at the end.
