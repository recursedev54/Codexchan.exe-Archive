Welcome to Fractal City! This is an in-the-works frozen cyberpunk city located just off the spawn of the Cozy SMP. We've been working on the city for a few months now, but recently we've become really dedicated to it. It includes huge redstone builds, a cryogenic villager tower, and an inn. Where the second floor is currently occupied by our little guy Raymond. We'd like to show you around! Hey friends, Violet is a comfy speedrunner that has been doing a little off-camera grinding on Cozy. They are going to be streaming their goated builds and giving a tour tomorrow at 8pm EST. More info in comments also, I love you!
