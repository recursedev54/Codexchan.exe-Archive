Well, it depends what you mean themselves, and it's hard to discover new relationships that computers can do. There have been computers which do things like problems, theorem proving in geometry or something, in which they've converted the problem of finding a proof of a theorem into a definite procedure, okay? And once you do that, although it's an elaborate and dumb way to do proofs, you can do it. The present time, a computer can't do all the different things that a person can do, you know? It's very difficult to find some way of defining rather precisely something we can do that we can say a computer will never be able to do. There are some things that people make up that say that while it's doing it, will it feel good, or while it's doing it, will it understand what it's doing, or some other abstraction. I rather feel that these are things like, while it's doing it, will it be able to scratch the lice out of its hair? No, it hasn't got any hair or lice to scratch from, okay? So you've got to be careful when you say what the human does. If you add to the actual result of his effort some other things that you like, the appreciation of the aesthetic. You didn't do that. I'm not saying you did. But a lot of people do that when they ask questions. And if we add things that we think we're doing on top of what we actually do, and just look at not just the result of what we're doing, but a lot of extra things, then it gets harder and harder for the computer to do it because the human beings have a tendency to try to make sure that they can do something that no machine can do.
