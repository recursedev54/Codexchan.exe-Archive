All right, friends, if you want to save this account and make it pretty, this is your chance. You gotta spam those comments and pull me out of the hellhole I'm in. I'm trying to make a comfy deer, but clearly I've been sucked into the shadow realm. Gotta pull out of here. I get some Gracie niceness sometimes, but I can't make the deer's face. Probably because it's cursed deep down. We can do this, gays. We have to fight the edgelords. It keeps pulling me back into cursed stuff. Why can't I make the face that is spooky in and of itself? Why the face, man, if something is going on? I'm permanently cursed, aren't I? Just give it to me straight. Can Baker Posting solve this? That last one spooked me, not gonna lie.
