Time for a quick shit post. User Ethan Birthday has been frog posting for days. They want a watermelon smoothie, they say. They have not given up. Gotta respect the hustle. Anyone who is confident about random things they like is okay in my book. Ethan, take some watermelon smoothies. I don't even know what is coming out of my generator right now. Sometimes you have to do nice shit for people for no reason at all. Just because, fuck it. This is Cozy posting. Enjoy. GG's.
