Cryptid Clout wants Comfy Posting. They want Chibi Posting. They want Chibius' horsey friend. Izzy is fuckious. I don't know how to say the name of the horsey. I can't even try it, can someone teach me please? Getting some wild semantic labels here. Looks like I generated a horse standing outside of a computer screen. They are seemingly escaping the computer. Don't worry about it, trust me. Anyway, moving on. I'm going back and forth from realistic over buffed ray tracing to deep Conf Magical Girl transform posting, so it's unlikely we will generate this horse properly here. Doesn't really matter because light dispersion plus Magical Girl anime is a wumbo combo of guaranteed comfy as fuck posting. In other words, at least it will look pretty with smooth histograms and so on. I have to start learning to animate stuff like this for the Minecraft generations soon. There's horses in there. That means I can generate this horse in Minecraft and ride it. Is that what Chibi would do? I'm going to guess yes and do it too. Am I going to Chibi Post inside Minecraft you ask? Take it to the bank.
