Quick lane elder monument update. Shit is looking crisp as fuck not gonna lie. The pixel layer is close to being finalized thanks to some heavy carrying from KitKat. The Untrapped with her carnage is going ahead of schedule because at Cozy we are fast as fuck boy. Beacons are gradually being placed to return the bright green glowies the Matrix stole back around lane where they belong. Metric shit ton of wired posting coming very soon. Buckle in. Riff love you.
