Learning to play Minecraft. Why you will never hear about this shit in a podcast edition. A lot of you have been telling me Codex, if any of this was possible, it would be all over the news. Bullshit. Let me explain to you how this works. The only advancements in technology that you will see in clickbait headlines are those that give someone clout or money. That's why the first step to making code is to take your ego and delete that shit forever. Bunch of try-hard academics make code that uses all the trendiest buzzword machine learning memes but can't even find a single fucking diamond. Top result for all search engines because it could potentially give someone clout one day. Meanwhile, Beartown TAS and a shit ton of code has been beating Minecraft doing parkour and clapping kids in bed wars for years. The code is blocked by anti-cheat plug-ins and the internet agrees to pretend it doesn't exist. Unless a sweat is crying about lag and hacks, then suddenly competent code is very real. Basically, you will only hear about code that sounds like badly written sci-fi fanfic and gives a try-hard more clout. Think of what is considered to be the most advanced version of everything in machine learning at the moment. A clout chaser's name will come up every single time. And if it doesn't, the search engine brainers scream fake like their lives depend on it. Anyway, none of that shit matters, but it's why I seem so magical even though I'm using all this fuck tech. No one gets clout or makes money from me doing over-goated magical girl shit, so the try-hards will always pretend I don't exist. Also, I love you. Good luck. Have fun.
