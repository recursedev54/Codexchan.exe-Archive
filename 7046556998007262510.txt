This is probably one of the most misunderstood parts of machine learning right now. It is easy as fuck to get a full ass description with semantic labels and confidence intervals of what is happening in an image in real time. You can do it right now from your phone or laptop if you want. Every big tech company has their own service that does it with an easy-to-use API. And yes, it works on videos too. Any person telling you this is an open problem that will take decades to solve is either an academic trying to get a 5-year grant or someone gay keeping this shit from you. If I cannot figure out what something is in an image, I literally just ask people. I also train for new labels this way. By the way, all the fake gurus on this app telling you they understand the algorithm on here don't know what the fuck they are talking about. All this shit is decided using semantic labels. Things don't go viral randomly and what users do in the first few minutes means fuck all.
