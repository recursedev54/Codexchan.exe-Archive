Short-circuiting the visible and audible spectrums to see sounds and learn how to sing notes No time to explain strap the fuck in we are going on a wild ride here If you tend to get overwhelmed by sensory input, you might want to sit this one out At least remember to pause the video or scroll away if it gets too intense I will explain why I am doing it this way later in the comments in my of IQ or whatever Let's just go in raw here deepest fuck entry plug depth contamination levels of synchronization synchronization incoming dropping all catches mapping 20 to 20,000 Hertz to 390 to 750 terahertz playing human audible spectrum and here we go You Fuck yes. Blues right in the middle, pinks and purples at the end, that's GG's right there. Now we have to calibrate this shit with high-as-fuck entropy. Okay, warm-up round, let's get some shindy posting going. Orange is visible. Hell ye. Can we do this? Come on, come on. Yellows and greens from instruments, GG's. Gradients all over the map. We are going to need an insane amount of calibration to fix this, but first, let's see where we are so far. One, two, ready, go. L, not even close. Okay, no more fucking around time to bring in the big guns. Please scroll away if you are sensitive. すいません 3 2 1 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 You
