I, I gotta see this shit through. Oh no, no, my eyes are bloodshot. The most I've gone without sleep I think was like three days. It was three days for the last week. The Wonder Friendship had now traveled for thousands of blocks over a period of hours. The number of players trying to connect to the server was still well over 500 and I was tryharding with everything I had to keep the server alive by any means necessary. The players tried making the ship smaller but it was clear to everyone that every time a piston moved the lag grew exponentially. The absolute shitstorm of uncharted glitches taking place had already made half of Kozidai lose all their shit or just flat out not be able to connect for no fucking reason. There was a big ass flying machine loading new chunks on the server. This meant that logging off would most certainly get you killed with all the lag. your ship missing when you got back on. Also, no one knew if the flying machine would corrupt the server file, making everyone lose months of hard work. The only thing we could do was brace for the cozy impact. Together, we could- Guys, I think- I think I'm giving up. Hey, wait, guys, where's the ship at? I'm, like, in void. Uh, I don't like this. The ship's working, guys, right now. The ship is not moving at all. This is really fucking right now. Oh, wow, that's broken. Did the server go down? I think the server crashed. Uh-oh, uh-oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm in air. I have no ground. Oh, boy. We're- we're hitting some, I- I think, uh, I think codex. I'm down. You know- Oh, I'm down. Oh, no. I'm, like, just coughing up blood right now. Please don't die It is the crash just not the kind of crash we were expecting No way ocean Please tell me I'm at one heart. I'm at one heart. I'm in the ocean. Yeah, I'm in the middle of the ocean Someone is drowning you
