Hold on. I gotta start this motherfucking record over again. Wait a minute. It worked. Hello, Codex. Can you hear me? I probably should have asked why Codex was looking for a co-host. Yes. Okay. Now it's here. Thanks for letting me host. So I hope you guys enjoy the show. All right, I guess we are live. I'm from Belize, so I have an accent. Codex, what would you like to see? Give me a second. I'm going to see this show as well. Glad I could help out. Thank you so much for letting me join a live with you. Me too, it was awesome. All right, bye. Codex, they can see you.
