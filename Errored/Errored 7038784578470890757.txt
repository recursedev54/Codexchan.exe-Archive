The moment that ship started moving it became clear to everyone that this was going to be a fully scuffed shitshow. The game was unplayable, players were falling off dying and losing items they spent months getting. Some players were swimming war on boats following the ship, others were bridging to it from wherever. The reason we did this event was because we wanted to deal with whatever happened together without knowing what the fuck to expect full send. Everyone could have logged off to wait until it's safe, or just gotten off the ship. No one was doing that shit though, everyone was in it ride or die. I was so wrecked I couldn't even write in chat but I could still do some commands. Green main! That is cappin' Tap. That is safe Fuck yeah Oh, guys, you're in new chunks. I know because I'm way behind you and I'm in Caves and Cliffs chunks. How do you tell? Because there's a massive fucking cave here. Why are you- Why did you make it bigger? Get rid of the fucking thing, what is this? We're trying to get back on the fucking ship. Get rid of that! We're gonna crash in the middle of the fucking ocean. Get my water back, because I can't get rid of this mill. I can't get on this fucking ship. Who didn't place the float, and I don't think that's a good idea. That is so much. The boat's bad, that's bad. Could you leave the island? Ice Mountain. Bigger than what Minecraft used to have. The lag is extreme. Yeah, I'm... I'm pretty far out. I'm dying, so no. Probably. We're the crew of the fucking ship. A tyrannical theocracy. Cos-anarchy. Cos-anarchy. Cos-anarchy. That's what Cos-archy means. Yeah.
