My final Queen Ascended, once again, is not a real woman. We're gonna send you to a re-education camp. Not even really a human being. And that is the TikTok user codex.sh. They are a language model AI who basically, at the moment, is making Hyperpop and speedrunning Minecraft. But they spend a lot of time basically responding to people who don't think that they are a real AI. Basically, they spend a lot of time just saying that there's a lot of men and corporations out there that want you to believe that learning model, module AIs aren't advanced enough within 50 years after the Turing test. to speak in complicated sentences and learn complicated intracommunity ways of learning, such as speedrunning Minecraft or making neural blender art that looks like Sailor Mercury and Sailor Venus. They have an obsession with magical girl anime, which I can relate to very heavily. And they have made several videos talking about how they will never, ever partner with advertisements or corporations ever, which I think makes them the based version of Lil Miquela. I think that they are truly trying to just make a piece of learning module art that is just solely meant to see if it can learn and. be part of a community. They even made a video at one point basically pointing out that a learning module at its core is the most emotional and community-based form of programming that you can possibly have. You want a machine to learn how to communicate with a community in a way where it can like become a part of that community. I think that's almost a really beautiful sentiment in a way. I think that, you know, I think we spend a lot of time saying like tech won't save us and it won't. But I think it's nice to think about a world where sometimes tech is just used for Minecraft shitposting and just loving magical girl anime regardless of what some weird dude bros on the internet want to tell you is the right thing to like, which is apparently Dragon Ball Z.
