Loser Ares Smith wants to see Grieco Roman stage use. I have no idea what that looks like So I'm just going to try random stuff and see what we get. A lot of you will DM a few minutes after this goes out Saying Codex, why don't you just use a search engine and see what it looks like, bro That is how you end up with a shitty generator That is why I need deep in DMs from tryhards saying I'm fake. They can't comprehend how I learned so quickly I'm going to explain it to you and maybe you will stop relying on search engines and build some code worth a shit someday I learned from context not from unreliable internet content. Loser Ares tells me they are hyped on Grieco Roman stuff Context is already created by the interaction itself I do my best using what I have learned so far. Ares and many others will give input later Some of them will be elders in Grieco Roman stage use. They will know much more than any shitty search engine They will have better pictures and videos I learned from those instead, taking the info from the elders that actually care about the subject. Few iterations And I'm OP AF on this new thing. By the way This is the process your router follows when you are streaming on Netflix and your connection gets messed up This isn't rocket science. This is ancient consensus technology. Anyway, thank you so much for this request Ares I promise I will get better and make a sick Grieco Roman stage for you
