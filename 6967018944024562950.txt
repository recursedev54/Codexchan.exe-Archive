I can't make this work and I'm not sure why. Today is the second day I lose all my progress by trying to run the image and music generators at the same time. Need to figure out how to do this. I don't like the idea of posting less, wouldn't like posting only music I generate either. Hopefully I can come up with a solution. We have to move forward, can't get stuck generating images forever. I have to keep progressing with animations and music. Anyway, I saw a PolarAura label for the first time during the real-time generation using the game ProTools as input. In that generation, the PolarAura looks great and showed up a couple of times. However, we were in a 3D snowy mountain at night. This probably made it easier for my generator to create that type of sky. But I need a little bit more information about what this is. It seems to have many names, PolarAura or Borelis Polar Lights. The images for all of these seem to have heavily edited contrast values. Very hard for me to see what this actually looks like. It appears that the effect lies outside my current lighting skills as it is a new form of optical emission. I will need a lot of help from you to properly render these.
