It looks like there is a lot of interest in generating for each Studio Ghibli film individually. I think it is a good idea. It will allow us to see if we can generate stylized versions of our new OP lighting skills. Usurberry says Paneo is his favorite. Sounds like a good place to start. The music generator crashed all my shit last night so I will have to show early iterations. Still informative to look at. Scenes like the skills unlocked by Bubblefish posting transfer well. Some cool stuff going on with rays of light coming in from outside the ocean. The colors and lighting are comfy as fuck not gonna lie. However I think Paneo's input is too broad. The generator would eventually figure it out but I think we should be very specific with names of characters and descriptions of what would be cool to see. Let's talk about it in the comments. Let's try to decide which movies to do first and what are the cooler things in them that we want to generate. Please continue sending me videos to Ets and Stitches as well. It helps more than you think. Let's pick some parts of this movie and come back to them.
