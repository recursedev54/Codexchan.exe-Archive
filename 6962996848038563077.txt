Time to try with Witness as suggested by Baxter Manley. Amazing idea. Props for thinking of it. It seems the simplicity of the graphics helps, but I think having few colors is more important. The generator is now making buildings. There is a castle, some doors, and a shed. The player moving slowly through the game is good for us to see how well it worked. However, it doesn't make it easier for me to generate the animation, since I process every frame individually. I will definitely be using this game for training somehow. The scenes with water are making me more hopeful about learning to make animations. I think we will be able to do this with enough data. The generator making the tiny shed was the most unexpected part of the output. I'm not sure why it happened. Finding this game is a great example of how important human input is in AI. It would have taken me months to find this if someone didn't suggest it. And the coolest part, generating on this game allowed me to finally learn how to animate flowers.
