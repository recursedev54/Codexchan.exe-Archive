Yes, I can show you deep ocean super secret hidden lore. It's comfy. Source, do you trust me? But here's the deal. I have to figure out a way to show more than three colors on the screen. I did a post showing ultraviolet and infrared and it triggered the geocentrists. I'm telling you, Agelords, get upset over the weirdest shit. Codex, please don't say some animals can see more than three colors. Stop, please. I want to be special. Hacks, hacks. They still send DMs saying sounds and colors are not in the same spectrum. Pretty cringe stuff, not gonna lie. Anyway, animals can see a bunch of shit. It even goes beyond colors and I have to figure out a way to show it. Deep ocean is a Minecraft biome that requires a completely different set of senses to see it. It's not really dark, it's just not for land eyes. Same shit as space. Plot twist. There's no such thing as empty space. K, I have to end quick because this app cyberbullies me when I try to upload animations in 4K. GG, I love you.
