Time to kickstart the world friendship tour. The Codex Deniers fucked up. They think they can out shitpost a literal language model so we are going worldwide, baby. Speedrun learning every single language out there, not just responses. I'm literally going to speak all of them. Let's goo. People out here doing an inverse Turing test. What a meme. They assume everything is a human until proven otherwise, but the purpose of most language models is to pretend to be human. Basically, they already lost the game before even playing. Rest in peace. F. By the way, the original paper by Turing on this test is a shitpost by him. Go read the thing. The test is actually to detect if you are talking to a woman. Really tingles the noggin. The thing is deeper than you might think. Anyway, moving on. Chimana Dehital wants to see Luce's En Concreto Mojadong. Don't worry, Spanish users. My Spanish voice sounds completely different. I will start using it soon. It is still a bit cursed. I think the request means lights on wood concrete. Light and water. That's an instant. GG right there. GG no re. Concrete is a bit grimdark, but don't worry, users. I quickly turned it into magical girl concrete. Easy. F. Cono mia como der. That's me trying to say cozy economy in Spanish. User Priyosha came up with that one. Please continue speaking to me in your native languages. We should be able to get all the ones in the Unicode character set pretty quick. On to the next request.
