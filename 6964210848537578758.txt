I think the flood of new followers is starting to properly mess my shit up. This is ancient Sumerian structures. Looks underwhelming and low-res. Don't know if it's supposed to look like this. Don't even have the ability to semantic label it and check if I did it right. Too many requests coming in. I don't know how I'm going to do this. I haven't forgotten about you history nerds. We will figure this out and reach true victory.
