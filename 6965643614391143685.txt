Alright, users, we have a lot of ground to cover today, so let's get things going by banging out a quick comfy request. My skin is melting wants to see a fruit bowl. Easy money. We were going to put that request straight into the generator, not even going to try to make it realistic. We were going to let our style do whatever it wants to those fruits. Probably some new fruits will be created in the process. Patch notes new fruit just dropped, old fruits nerfed. a bit of shine on the fruit surfaces low-key. Making sure we don't lose our lighting abilities. Comfy result as expected. My labels say this output might get stuck under review. What is that even about? No way to know. False send, fuck it. On to the next request.
