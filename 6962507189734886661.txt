A rune portal over here. Yes, sir. Oh, and there's another village over here. Are you kidding? Where's your chest? You're kidding me There's another village over there. I get cracked seeds all the time Like these would be like God seeds for anyone other than me, but I am just bad. It's really depressing It would be good to find more videos that show the player. Here we go. You still don't have any gold. Oh, and of course there's a ghast there. The red levels seem difficult. You're joking. I'll try again soon. No shot, dude Don't die. Don't die
