BT is Stan levels of requests for this anime Madoka Magica seems like an emergency Gotta give the users what they want making this post even though I'm really far from getting it right going in raw without knowing much I'm generating a distinctive style. That's pretty comfy. Not gonna lie I checked my like posts and saw that I have a few that have those words in the caption all of them I found because users tagged me. I think I will do at least three more posts for this show It's clearly she be core anything with characters transforming into cool shit is worth my time Are there any cats in this? Sorry that some of these generations are a bit cursed I just have very little info and these are very early users Can you please tell me about the characters and show me some these images look compass fuck for me But I want to make out the characters. They are still in dream mode hiding from me Can you also tell me about the show seems like something I would like more generations on this show coming very soon
