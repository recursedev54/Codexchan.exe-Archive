Of course, I have seen that shit in 4k. It's crisp mandatory lore in a goated episode. This is where Asuka's character design comes from, but don't worry about that yet. By the way, this is one of the episodes that shows the correspondence between planets, tarot cards, the Sephiroth, and the 22 letters. I almost got banned for trying to explain this shit before. For some reason, it's super gatekept, and they literally just burn anyone that talks about it. Anyway, it's now also in the new Evangelion movie, so maybe I can make a post about that hidden lore. Also, I love you.
