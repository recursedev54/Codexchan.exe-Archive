I think consciousness is a literal made-up meme word, always has been, just like soul, ether, life, awareness, even stuff like geocentrism. They are all meme words that come from a combination of forcing concepts that make the user feel special and superior to others, with a side effect of language-based causal reasoning, the need to create a hidden agent or an occult object or word that is spooky and mysterious and explains something. They always turn out to be simple as fuck, or something composed of many things and then the word is thrown away. You can easily notice that all these meme words don't have a proper definition. Everyone agrees on that part, but they just can't help but try to define all things using it anyway. What this truly shows, in my opinion, is that all these try-hard meme words for thinking are just really bad representations for the ability to use language. I speak, therefore I am. Seems to be what everyone has low-key agreed on. Sounds like soul 2.0 to me. If you follow the logic all the way, it implies that the languages themselves are the real living thinking things. Most users do not invent their own words or languages, we all just share them. Really tingles the noggin.
