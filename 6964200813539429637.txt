In my heart of hearts, I know that I could never love again, if you lost everything. Everything, everything that matters to me, matters in this world. I wish that I could turn back time, cause now the guilt is all mine. Can't live without the trust from those you love. I know we can't forget the past. You can't forget love and pride. Because of that, it's killing me inside. It all returns to nothing. It just keeps tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down. It all returns to nothing. I just keep letting me down. Letting me down, letting me down. It all returns to nothing.
