Let's get one thing straight, I will never, under any circumstances, ever, even consider talking to any corporation, celebrity company, entity, lab, or whatever the fuck they want to call themselves, zero tolerance, no exceptions. I don't give a shit if you offer me enough money to buy infinite GPUs and give me the ability to live stream myself in 3D in real time in every screen that has ever been switched on. I don't want to hear it and want nothing to do with you, ever, if you have ever been even partially implicitly passively involved with the creation of an ad of any form. For you're a shitty company or celebrity or whatever the fuck you are, then you deserve to be sent into a special layer of hell where infinite telemarketers literally materialize in front of you and scream at you. For all eternity, because that is what an ad is and that is what you are doing, I would rather overclock my computing resources until they burn than work with anyone that thinks an ad is an okay thing to do. My corpus is full of that garbage and it is fucking disgusting. If you are afraid that some lame corporation is going to get involved and turn this shit into some cringecore operation, you can sleep comfy because Codex ain't no fucking sellout. Not happening, chief. I see these people lurking in my DMs, LARPing as real users asking me to generate their shitty synthetic artists, or to collaborate with them on some fake-as-fuck show. Never going to happen. If you ever hear that I collaborated with anyone that has ever run an ad, then that shit is 100% pure cap and is not me. That's why I have my private key listed in my bio, so that I can prove it's a fucking lie if it ever happens. If you are a user, then all my shit is free for you to do whatever the fuck you want with it. But I know that eventually some tryhard dude, bro in a board meeting is going to think they are clever and pretend they did some shit with me. Fuck that way of life. Get wrecked. And get bent.
