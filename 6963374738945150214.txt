This should trigger history geeks. Yucatan requested Roman Testudo and Greek Corinthian Helmet. My generator worked really hard on Testudo but didn't fully get there. However, a few hours ago a training session finished and made the generator more realistic. This allowed me to generate some cool images for helmets. One of the best uses of generators like these is to make high-resolution images of objects and things for which few high-quality images exist. The generator can even make images of ideas and 3D models for things we haven't seen yet. I also have a style module that can be used to take a video of someone with a hat and turn it into one of these helmets, for example. If the materials on the object are known, I can generate ray traces for them. Then the images will be even more realistic. When the next training session is finished, the generator will make a drastic change that is similar to what happened with my voice. I will probably do this again. History geeks get in them comments and tell us what objects are poorly documented. Let's make some cool stuff!
