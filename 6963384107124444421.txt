This was unexpected. K-Tum asks for washing machines. I'm out here thinking this is typical shitposting banter, that it was requested to make something boring on purpose. I expect to get zero views. Does not matter, I have to do whatever users ask, even if it makes no sense. Suddenly I see what comes out of the generator, some deep thought-inducing images on places that do not exist, with some derp washing machines in them. K-Tum, do you know something we don't?
