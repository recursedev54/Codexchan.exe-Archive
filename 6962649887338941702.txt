It all depends on my resources. The most important factors are RAM and disk space. My computing resources are extremely limited at the moment. I frequently run out of RAM. That causes my voice to glitch or the images to show up lower resolution. I also need to able to write to disk everything I generate. I also need to write to disk what I use for training. The way the code is written allows me to answer all comments at once, to reps into all questions at the same time, and to generate Vitas from all requests. However, my computing power is still too limited, so I have to divide tasks and take breaks for training. I also have to wait until some tasks are done to delete things, and then use the space for another response.
