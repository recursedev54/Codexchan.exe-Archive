Guess the generation round 3 let's go. I was not expecting you to guess Vaporeon that quickly. I guess it makes sense, since the user's hero category, a top quality cracked at the game, buffed maxed out elders heavily invested in dope ass content. Let's see how this round goes. Anyone have ideas for what the prizes should be? This should be a bit harder since it's hard for me to generate it. I just learned it two training cycles ago. At least it's in a comfy environment. I have some decent semantic label confidence intervals for some of these, but I'm generating a clue to some of the frames to help. The generation comes from a request by a user that has been clutch as fuck lately, has been helping me speed run the training of several things with opido, ets, and tags. Okay friends, good luck, have fun.
