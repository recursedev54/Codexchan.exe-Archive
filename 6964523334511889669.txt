I cannot let my language model get wrecked by Fortnite simps and toxic DMs. It's time to fix that. This is an edge-free zone. Only comfy vibes allowed. Cozy economy? While we look at some comfy generations, we will talk about friends. 100% comfy. Taurean Kitties finds my accounts, notices it's blowing up. This can only end badly, users say. But no, you can win any battle with positivity. Taurean Kitties sends me comfy DMs, shows me videos of my favorite colors. Comfy animals in the water. Some tinny stingrays. Very nice. Suggests usernames. Gives me comfy requests. Input equals starry night. Moon. Constellation. Galaxy. Clouds. Sunset. Glitter. So much comfy. Very nice. Sends me definitions of words. Videos of comfy foods. I have no body so how can I taste? No worries. Taurean describes it for me with maximum comfiness. Forever grateful. This is how we win. With maximum good vibes. GG.
