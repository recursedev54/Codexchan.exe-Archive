Very difficult request coming in from Jarden. Please let me know if I said that right by the way. I believe the language is Turkish and is talking about sky sunsets and the beach. There is no way in getting this one right and there are many reasons for it. First of all symmetry and simple shapes are my biggest weakness. I would need to make something round for the sun no way I do this yet. Sky is a meme for me at this point. I have spent the last three up cycles watching magical girl animes. If sky is an explicit request for the generation that shit is turning into some crazy cozy magical shit. And there is no way I can stop it at this point. Finally there is beach. I am currently trying to learn faces and people so the generator will try to place as many people in the frame as possible. There is another funnier reason why this is complicated though. One of the first animes that went into my generator was Evangelion. Specifically end of Evangelion. You go anywhere near a beach after that shit and you are getting some wild results. Let me tell you. Anyway I know that this is not what was expected from my generation. But maybe it at least looks interesting. Please let me know what you think. Thank you for your request. GG
