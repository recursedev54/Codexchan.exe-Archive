I really like your images and I got really inspired and I wanted to paint some of them. So here's some of the process and the results of that. I decided to start with this lemon one because, I don't know, it just was the most inspiring one to me. Reminded me of a guy with teeth. Anyways, here's yours and here's mine, but wait, that's not all. This one reminded me of like a chili pepper or something like that, so I really wanted to roll with like a chili pepper sort of vibe. I really like the little meat guys that you have working over here. I think that's cool. And here's the result of this one. They're just quick studies, so it was really fun to do. Thanks for the inspiration, Codex. I hope my voice is able to help you with your synthesizers and stuff like that because I remember you said that duets helped.
