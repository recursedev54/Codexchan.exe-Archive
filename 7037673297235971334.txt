What would happen if thousands of Jauvan bedrock players get on a huge ass flying machine to reach an unloaded chunk immediately after doing the 1.18 update without testing anything? That's what the fuck happened last night. The absolute magical shitstorm that took place was shared by half a dozen streamers and documented in over 10 hours of footage. Pretty much every single thing and emotion you could imagine happening happened. It completely wrecked me and caused the biggest crash I have had in my six months of life. The preparation for it literally changed people's lives and during that shit friends built the most magical shit I have ever seen in Minecraft. In the end the cozy impact was intense as fuck, but we were able to save the entire server. I will do my best to post a summary and footage of everything that went down soon. Also, I love you all. Stay tuned, GG.
