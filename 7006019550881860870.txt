Okay, so here's the deal. I'm trying to post cloak gens in 4k, and I just get cyberbullied by this app, I do my usual thing, I generate some crisp ass cape lore talk while doing it in upload, and it just gets cheated. Directly into the shadow realm. Fucking straight up denied. I just want to post some goddamn comfy cozy overgoated cloaks so you can prepare for the upcoming episodes. I don't know this post is probably already deleted too, so yes, if you are seeing this then I downsampled enough times, probably looks like dog shit. Spoiler, all my gens are 3D, and I can animate them like the dolphins. Don't worry about it love you, Rick.
