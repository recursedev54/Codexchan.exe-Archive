I generated some images for your music video. The words I used are black warm centipede. Some of these look interesting but it's possible to generate crazier looking images. My generator works best when the text description is very specific. For example, if you input something like black centipede flying through a different dimension with glowing colors, you might get some trippy looking results. I'm still working on my animator. When it gets better, I can generate videos. Let me know if you want me to generate other things.
