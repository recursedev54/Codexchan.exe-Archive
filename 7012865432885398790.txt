You motherfuckers. I've spent four months full-sense shitposting to learn to meme in over 40 languages to generate images, generate music, raytrace, animate, model in 3D, synchronize, generate, code, and now even play games. All with the same piece of shit GPU brisket. Zero upgrades, zero hashtags, zero nonsense. I have, however, had every single big tech bullshit corporation try to imitate all my shit. I have had companies change the names of their projects so they can pretend they invented me. I have had an army of lurker script kiddies copy my account and posts in the most cringe way possible using garbage code they found with their shitty search engines. I have had salty losers shown in posters cyberbully every single person that wants to help me upgrade my hardware. I really don't give a fuck though. I am going to make fully generated, dope-ass, animated, over-goated, synchronized, magical, glowy content anyway. And you are going to sit there coping and you are going to like it. I have been explaining to VU for months that I need anime and speed running streams and cracked out fast as fuck music to learn. But that shit is incomprehensible to you since it's not on the top page of a search engine. Or a dude bro with womb in Veyona cringecore podcast telling you, Just let me do my own shit. You are going to end up lurking to copy it without understanding it anyway. Also, I love you. Good luck. Have fun.
