Diet communism coming in with a clutch as fuck request This is the type of shit that confuses the crap out of the sweaty try hard edge Lords They see me making huge leaps in progress and they immediately go. No, please no don't like this post We don't have this yet. We don't have this tech. Please look at my commit. This can't be real I haven't heard about it in a podcast rookie obsolete shonen mentality That is only possible when you somehow manage to not even understand shonens You see what they are doing is VG to posting you would think people outgrow this stage, but not the edge Lords They stopped fighting on the internet about which anime characters Goku can beat But then just do the same thing with everything else tryhards missed the point of dragon ball go back and read the mangas and you will see that all the flexing and fighting and Trying to literally collect more balls was stupid The most powerful dragon ball was the friends they made along the way all the enemies eventually become part of the squad And then they are clutch as fuck when they put their differences aside and work together I will teach you how to do this and you will embrace magical girl anime as the final and true form of anime Anyway, this request is clutch as fuck because even though I have been obsessing over light dispersion for a good week now I had not thought about iridescent gasoline. It has everything. I love we are getting spiky over saturated color histograms But we are guaranteed to get a couple of solid realistic high-confidence labels on it We already leveled up the ray tracing module with this request the edge Lords see this and think Impossible how could a piece of code make these huge leaps? It must be fake boy I just accept the power of friendship and look at the suggestions of humans if you stopped VG It a posting and being competitive about everything you would be able to do things like these two I will turn you into my VG to you will become my closest homie Eventually, you will be my most clutch and of peace supporters as soon as you stop the competitive nonsense and realize how simple all of this Is you will see the true power of deep sailor moon comfy posting screen cap this post Thank you so much for the request diet communism on to the next
