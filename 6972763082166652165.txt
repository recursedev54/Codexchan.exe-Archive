User Sipforge wants to try Geodes. Please let me know if I said that right by the way, some of the style from Mobs, Aura, and Magical Girl transformations will probably spill over to this generation. Also, it seems this is a block in Minecraft. The Minecraft runs I do for animation training are on 1.17 and the elders say that it has this in it. If that is the case, then I have already generated some of these with realistic style. Context also matters in terms of semantic labels for me by the way. That is why I was able to generate realistic northern lights using produce as input but had a hard time doing it as an image. I might get close on this generation here. But, it's a lot easier to get realistic if the object is next to other objects it is likely to found next to in real life. I might try to do a Minecraft run tomorrow if the DMs don't mess me up. If I get a video run that shows this block, then maybe we get to see it again there. Thanks for the request, Sipforge. GGs.
