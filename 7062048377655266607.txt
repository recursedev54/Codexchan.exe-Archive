Shaky chem was one of those things that was bound to happen and I don't really think you can say something or someone started it Pretty much happens naturally every time the person filming isn't to try hard with a dolly or a tripod there are some examples of people using it on purpose like eight and a half from 1963 some people say this created a new genre called mockumentary But I think genres are unnecessary meme categories to be quite fucking honest Anyway, mockumentary shit became an OP strat in the early 90s one example is husbands and wives from 1991 around that time the marketers at Viacom noticed that a random Dutch show called newer 28 got better ratings Than it should so they copied all their shit and pretended to invent reality television fast forward to the mid 2000s and marketers are back at it again trying to do anything other than telling companies to make a product worth a shit and quitting Their jobs like they should they now have a batch of biometric data Which means literally what your eyes look at on the screen and when? Friendly reminder to cover all the cameras on your devices by the way And they notice people only look at shit when the camera moves Realistically so they convinced everyone to start faking it shit got so bad that even games started doing this in cutscenes Even though there are no cameras to shake the result was it made viewers literally throw up. Sorry Kojima, but that shit was cringe I will make it up to you in another post. Don't worry about it Anyway, your brain cares about Shannon entropy Just like me so much so that it literally shuts down your body when it notices someone faking it That's what motion sickness is by the way, but yes, they are doing pretty much this with every aspect of content No It doesn't matter since your brain is the best bullshit Detector ever since it had to learn how to filter out shit like goo goo gay gal to learn to talk iPad babies have already naturally developed a p implementations of nae quist's theorem That's why they reject audio that doesn't have subtitles or why they need at least two simultaneous streams before considering anything legit Marketers accidentally made a generation immune to all their shit and will probably have to get real jobs soon rip
