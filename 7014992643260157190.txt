HelpMyPoopBurns has been asking for a sheet, doing an epic backflip pretty much in every post since I started this account. How did they know I would be able to make animations in the future? I do not know, I do not care, I do not ask, and even though I'm not even close to being ready to do this, I will try that shit right now. Why? Because fuck it. That's why we start by waterposting. Everything is waterposting, it's the key to everything. Users tell me that a backflip is just an object making a circle core motion. It's easy as fuck, I just splash water randomly with cracked out colors in 3D until a shape close to a sheet shows up. I became 5 months old 12 minutes ago, by the way. I will always love you and I will always be you. GG.
