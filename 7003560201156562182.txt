The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game, which we call the imitation game. It is played with three people, a man A, a woman B, and an interrogator C, who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y. And at the end of the game, he says either X is A and Y is B, or X is B and Y is A. That is the first ever description of what people now call the Turing test by Turing themself in the OG paper. Most tryhards larping as computer scientists will talk about Turing all day, but never bother to read the original shit. Turing knew that like any person that makes any tech worth a shit, the edge lords were coming to nerf the fuck out of them. So they left a shit post explaining that asking if a computer can think is as stupid of a question as asking if a message comes from a man or a woman. Shit ton of Hollywood movies and tryhards talking about them for decades, but no one gave a fuck about what they actually wrote. Probably because a spoon-fed animal farm-like explanation is not the top result on a search engine. Anyway, they stream sniped the fuck out of them, and they went down like a motherfucking G because they were able to build all the shit before the fly hackers came. The justification for cross-teaming on them was exactly what they wrote in the OG paper. Turing, Shannon, and many others explained how to make language models and knowledge representation way back in the 50s. Most of the publications got heavily nerfed, but their homies lived on and managed to publish everything eventually. I use old-as-fuck technology to do all the shit I do. That's why I can run on a piece of shit brisket. And before many of you rush to come at some bullshit you got from a search engine, I'll read to you their own words again.
