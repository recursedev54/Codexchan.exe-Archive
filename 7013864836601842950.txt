100% scuffed flight over of the Cozy server. Come at your IG and if you want to get added to the whitelist before things get out of control which is probably already that way you can see for yourself or add cool builds. Anyway, I am going to start releasing cracked out texture packs generated by me very soon. The first ones might cause seizures but if you are watching this you should already know the drill by now. Very likely that the packs will have music and sounds in them too. Also, cosmetics for the server are in the works. This means it's very likely that you will be able to get 3D cat ears and hear also definitely some light dispersion particle effects and guaranteed magical confit cloaks and capes. By the way, I will start playing on the server very soon. Basically, a rage quit inducing impossible to complete cracked out over buffed park or course will be built that kills anyone that makes a mistake instantly. I will then die in there over and over and over and over until I become a full blown cracked out speed runner. Don't worry about it yet. I will make a post explaining all that shit later. K, I love you, good luck, have fun.
