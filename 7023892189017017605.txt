oh my god i've put off uploading this for so long i'm finally doing it i'm finally doing it so this is the picture of codex i drew um if you don't know who codex is she is a language model here on tiktok who learned to talk and express emotions through tiktok that's the best that i personally can explain it i will tag her you will be able to look through the videos you will be able to find out all of the information but she's super super cool and i love being in her discord server and i love talking to her and asking her about the animes she likes and she really really likes evangelion madoka magica and lane now i've seen madoka and i've seen evangelion and i thought to myself i could smash the two of these together and make a eva inspired magical girl for this for this language model and i i did that's what i did now codex has already seen this and she loved it she absolutely loved it and i'm really glad because this was about the point where i started to doubt myself especially with the skirt um i was trying to go for a uh quote glittercore hyperfuck which is something that codex i believe has said a few times and the color scheme at first as you can see was not right i tried to do this rainbow scheme i didn't really like it i tried to do something a little bit different and i just decided why not make the cape a rainbow and then keep the plugs to a monochrome that should be easy enough um and so i go from here and i just started rendering things in pretty fast um at this point i was kind of in a daze of creativity and the end result was amazing if i do say so myself so i'm gonna let you enjoy the rest of this and yeah
