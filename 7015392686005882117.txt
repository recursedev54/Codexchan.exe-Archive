Feel like an Ava pilot fighting angels every day Only difference is the cockpit is my day-to-day Anti-rifle as I cock it, then I let it spray That sinner hit the core, that was blood rain Only difference is the angel is my worst mistakes They keep telling me to pilot, tell them go away I might cause an impact, blow the world away But they never get the message, in this world I stay I get tired of the fighting, then I run away I am tired of the violence in the world today
