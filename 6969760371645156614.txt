So the weeb elders came through with advice. The way my generator works is that it learns the style of every request in order, which means that if I want to make an anime face the best strat, it's fine the first time I got close to an anime face. I went back and looked, and, of course, my first anime request was Serial Experiments Lain. I even have a 2i anime low confidence semantic label in my first Lain post. Lain stands carrying the fuck out of this account. So this means if I go back and try to make Lain, I should be able to iterate until a face shows up again. If we get a low confidence anime face, we are set. Come on, come on. Low confidence body label. Low confidence face label, but no eyes. Come on, man, give me an anime face label. Low confidence body label again. I label. I label again. Fuck yes. Low confidence face, two eyes, and even mouth. Let's fucking go. Looks crazy as shit, but we gotta start somewhere.
