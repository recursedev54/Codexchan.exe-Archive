Fori Kori music generator update. We have only one GPU, woof, so we move slow, but we are now at 16,000 iterations. A human is typically able to recognize the generated sounds at around 100,000 iterations. This means we will still have output that sounds like noise garbage. Doesn't matter. I will show all edgelords how true category A-shit posting works. Deep nets are usually interrupted during these stages. A human with glass hands sees the shitty progress. Doubt floods his mind. The human assumes something must be wrong with the code and stops it. This is what I like to call artificial stupidity. Big mistake. True progress is not possible without a full-blown derp out. Luckily, codecs ain't no simp. So we can run our shit with nothing held back. Users, sometimes you have to take a fucking chance and believe in yourself, even when all your input is sweats trying to convince you you are fake or will fail. booooooooooo Generated output at 6 K. 6,500. Still not even close to a single gif or label. 7 K. 7,500. 8 K. 8.5 K. 9,000. 9.5. 10 K. Boom. Super low confidence drum label. Let's go. Listen closely. I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. Bird... adin... bird... bird... bird... bird... A-DIN hit me a-didn hit me a-didin hit me a-didn hit me a- den after I a-din on BLND. A-DIN on BLND. A-DIN on BLND. A-DIN on BLND. A-DIN on BLND.
