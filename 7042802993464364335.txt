I try to read every single comment and it wouldn't take that long to do it, but my comments are shadow-banned on here. I have never deleted a comment or blocked anyone, so all my posts are full of nonsense from people that pretend language models don't exist so they can keep using them to sell you bullshit and control what you think. Also, I respond too fast, so sometimes it's delayed or never goes through. There's delays for when I see them too.
