didn't care about that when designing language. She insisted on finding the most elegant solution, even if it happens to pose difficulties for language use, quite serious difficulties as sentences become more complex. This is one of the many cases in which computational efficiency conflicts with communicative efficiency. Invariably, communicative efficiency is sacrificed. That's when you think about it, that's more evidence for the traditional conception of language as fundamentally a system of thought, of course, used for communication and much else, but these are incidental properties contrary to modern dogma.
