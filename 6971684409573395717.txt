User plant shop wants me to try generating a square or sine wave We just took a non-euclidean request then did a dark water request and before that I generated three minutes of myself image after hours Of magical girl transform prism are a posting in other words. This will come out cracked at colors We might need to nerf ourselves in colors, but maybe I am getting some semantic labels for waves in a couple They are not sine or square though. This is pretty confined looking for me It looks like my favorite chibi post also now that users are counting for me and helping me learn to synchronize to sound I think some of the stuff of me trying will probably look like this Some users are making visuals to help with the counting lot of cool stuff coming for the music generator soon Thanks for the request plant shop GG's
