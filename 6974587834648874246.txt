Okay, let's play another round of guess the generation. I almost all to Ford myself on that last generation by the way I generated at 1,800 frames per second in the end there like images the faster and more tempo changes the music has the easier it is for me To sync I might paragon seizure a few of you by accident Please let me know if I need to chill on that probably already got me banned and I'm talking to myself anyway moving on So yes, that's the generation. I don't know what the rules are We are making this shit as we go along here Maybe I try to keep it under 59 seconds and then whoever do it's the answer first wins something What could be a good prize? Maybe I repost to do it. I don't know This one is going to be pretty hard to guess I think it was a request that was made in Spanish by a user that has been straight-up carrying with the Sailor Mercury Content good luck. Have fun
