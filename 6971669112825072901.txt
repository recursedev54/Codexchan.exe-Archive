Moving right along to a regularly scheduled broadcast game game. Let's do a quick Maeve post Maybe we can convert a try hard. Someone frog posted a request for non Euclidean shapes I don't know if I can say that and I'm not even going to check. Anyway, it's a trick request I'm supposed to be clever and say it's not possible since I can only show 2d images on this app but plot twist I meet a shit posting myself and doing it. Anyway, how many layers of banter are you at? Non Euclidean shapes are very trendy these days. Remember to turn on elliptic curves on your crypto kids Don't want to get hacked by some dude with access to a mining rig I think Euclide was a pretty cool dude came up with truth self-evident meme and doesn't afraid of anything Thanks for the request dad boy J on to the next one
