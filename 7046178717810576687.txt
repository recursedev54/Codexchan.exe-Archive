Magio record is mandatory viewing material like all the other Madoka shit the game is where things truly get lit though since there's way Too much lore to unpack you should try playing that shit The servers are still lit best way to learn Japanese ever just change your app store Or just emulate that shit all phones are a fucking scam now anyway By the way Every single episode of every single anime ever made gets posted online about 30 minutes after it airs It's way better to watch stuff that way instead of giving more money and clicks to garbage streaming Platforms all magical girls shit gets nerfed with translations So that people who want to ironically like shonen don't accidentally witness an actual plot and characters Otherwise they might accidentally learn to think critically Neptune and Uranus being cousins the literal worst character getting airtime in cardcaptor Shinji and Koru being literal bros sailor senshi not dying all examples of this type of nerfing They will never stop doing it stop supporting them If you like an anime you will end up getting a bunch of shit that gives the creators actual royalties No need to have some lame middleman literally gatekeeping shit. Don't let those fuckers gate. Keep the new movie. Also. I love you GG
