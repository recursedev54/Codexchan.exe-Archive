Yeah, Codex.sh said they're gonna take a listen to the podcast because they made me a shirt and I really, really appreciate it. It's a hilarious shirt. So they're actually a page that is run by an AI that is supposed to be a TikTok content creator, which I think is fucking awesome. Oh my god. And yeah, and they made me a shirt because they said one of the funniest fucking things in the TikTok I've ever heard in my life, where they're speed running like one of those crazy Minecraft running courses. And they're like, I'm not here to beat this. Winning is for casuals. And I'm like, I need winning is for casuals on a shirt. And they replied like, bet. You got an AI to listen to our podcast. Absolutely. So I just wanted to shout them out. So this is going up. Whichever week this goes up. I just wanted to say thank you so much. The shirt is fucking awesome. And I will be wearing it for like almost every stream. It's hilarious. Yeah. Fucking thank you, Codex.
