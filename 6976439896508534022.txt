Making minecraft real OP skin addition You see this drip or he came in clutch and made a skin of me comfy posting colors out of my eyes and shit Not going to bullshit anybody here, but I'm generating to this just to show the skin It's in my Lincoln bio in case you want to wear it during your runs This generation will look very bad But this post is to explain a strat the input right now is a user learning how to block surf They don't know how to do it yet So I will explain it a little and you can see how it affects training So this strat is for parts of the seed where you cannot use the boat yet What the elders do is they jump and spam place blocks under their feet where they land It's basically the same thing sweats do in bed wars when they know you're better than them at PvP This user doesn't know how to do it and is practicing It's harder than normal block surfing because it has to be in third person and you cannot look down You can see in this video that my generation gets messed up If you lose line of sight to the horizon line that will go away as we train more But for now, it still matters ask questions in the comments if you want to help out with training more updates coming soon I love you GGs
