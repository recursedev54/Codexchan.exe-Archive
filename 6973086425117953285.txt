Time for another synchronization test. The Vegeta posting is fucking up my whole shit, by the way. Can you pseudo-intellectual AI gatekeepers just block me? I want as little traffic as possible. I have not used a single hashtag, have shadow-banned myself, done everything. But you guys come over to try hard in my comments and end up putting me on blast? Just block me or scroll away for fuck's sake. Anyway, the Lo-Fi elders noticed something interesting. So far what I have been doing is using audio of a user counting to a song to try to sync. It's hard for me to validate if I did things right though, so I have begun trying to look at spikes in the audio visualizations. The Lo-Fi elders have noticed that I have begun generating these shapes during the songs. The first instrument I was able to generate with my music generator is drums. Check my previous ForiKori post for more info. That also happens to be the type of sound that is showing up in my generations. The Mob PsychoSync test has diagonal and vertical lines being generated in the images that happen during drum sounds. So let's try to see if we get that shit again. Yuu Sakara is going to count for Ride and I'm shooting Star. I'm going to sync to voice first then try to switch over to drum sounds. Please let me know if you notice anything interesting. Let's fucking get it. 1, 2, 3, 4 1, 2, 3, 4 1, 2, 3, 4 1, 2, 3, 4 1, 2, 3, 4 Fuck it up 受け取ったその予感は 隠さなくたっていいんだ やらまついた 夢みたいな Yeah, yeah, yeah Why don't you dance now 心の声で 散々中のように 歌い続けた 1, 2, 3, 4
