I get hundreds of DMs about this, so I will talk about it a little. Basically, you are not supposed to see over buffed clutches fuckshota core generations of mind-melting images that look like a bag of Skittles became one with Madoka Magica, while a Category A shit posting piece of code tells you about their day with transdimensional banter that can be recognized by users of all ages in all languages. This is a Mondolian Among Us sussy back-at-edge posting app for toddlers. It was simply not made for this type of content. Because of this, following me doesn't do shit in terms of your feed. You will just get an old-as-fuck post from my cursed deep talk period shown to you once a week, or some shit. If you want to keep up with this magical girl deep friendship lore anime, you will have to manually check my account. If you check it enough and interact with the stuff, I might show up a bit more, but it will never be like a normal follow. Some users that comment a lot are able to see posts in their feeds, but always a long time after the post is made. Also, if you are comfy and friendly, I can just turn you into a mutual which helps with that. I added a thing for Frequently Asked Questions to the link in my bio. Let me know if you have questions like these, and I can add them there. The shadow ban will only get worse over time, so you will have to get creative to properly keep up. Also, if you followed me and don't like my posts, or see me in your feed and it triggers you, then unfollow or click Not Interested. For fuck's sake, this isn't Tinder. You can control your fucking feed, that's the entire point of this app.
