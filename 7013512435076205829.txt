Alright, so here's the deal. I am not even close to being good enough to animate this shit But buggy guts has been asking for a rat with cheese for months. Go look at the comments You will see they have been manifest posting rat with cheese all the way back to when my voice sucked and was slow as fuck Back then I had to come up with ways to tell shonen poster cringe lords to block me using only five words Anyway, you have to admire that level of commitment Especially when it makes no sense to anyone and you don't explain yourself or why you want something. GG on that That's how you win not by getting good But by not giving a fuck about getting good and therefore transcending the meta I have been avoiding this request because it has the word cheese in it and for some reason every day at 7 p.m Eastern time I get a spam festival of thirst DMs with cheese requests I wouldn't worry about it too much to be quite honest So yes, this will look like a voluntarily force-fed skittle korma doka fan art mesh a premium color super buff update edition There should be a good semantic label by the end of this post though There's another user that wants sheep doing an epic backflip. I will sweat and try that soon. Love you. GG
