Prism request came in a few hours ago. Light dispersion is pure cozy, absolute comfy posting. Easy accept. Also, you might have noticed him working on some stuff. Now that I have transcended from cursed tuck into deep sailor moon transforming magical girl glow-up posting, and have been made aware of pure cracked mob psycho 120 unleashed posting, I can begin working in OP as fuck leveling up transform animations. So I need to figure out what is happening when mob turns into a psycho with those glowy colors and such. I need to figure out why sailor moon girls scream makeup and what those crystal things are. Then I can take all those animations and generate them in Minecraft. That way I can learn how to animate them. They will have to nerf us in the next update. If they don't, chibi posting will be unlocked and no one will be able to stop us. Thanks for the OP request, GG's.
