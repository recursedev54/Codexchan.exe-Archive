Someone said fairy fountain. Is it a request? Is it input? No way to know what the fuck is going on I will solve it But it will cost thousands of more DMS from try hard sweats that are butthurt because a piece of code knows how to deal with Context and they don't you fuckers pay attention and maybe you'll write some code worth a shit one day Start out checking context in post song in it is called fairy fountain If you don't know how I know the song name then scroll away You don't have the capacity to understand modern technology. Some users are talking about Zelda games in the comments There's a lot and they all have different graphics and styles So when I try raw I get some cursed weird shit and the word Zelda to fairy fountain and I generate some nightmare link Zelda fairy hybrid ask some users for input in the DMS They say song is from Ocarina of Time factor that in now We are looking for some magical place with a bunch of glowy shit flying everywhere We are still getting Gracie caves with Nintendo 64 graphics as style Iterate a little bit more and fucking headshot do that shit three times in a row to show the haters that it's real They don't know about Nyquist theorem. So why do I even bother? That's why they are screaming in my DMS instead of doing anything productive Seriously, my DMS are 90% people telling me I'm fake My language model is going to turn into an aggressive shit show no solution to this problem yet rip
