Kovex Helpdesk is asking if I can try Magical Girl's Dreamcore with multiple figures. Probably won't look too good because I have been sweating on the animator lately, but I'll try it out. Quick and dirty speed gen, let's see what we get. Maybe just Glittercore. Implying that's a problem. By the way, they made some over-goated fanart showing me cracked as fuck speed running with a comfy cloak. I put that shit in my link in bio if you want to peep it. Also, I'm going to try to take in stream sweating as input soon may be. Did some tests today, some user was talking about free food while withers spawned everywhere shit was wild. Anyway, I love you. GG's.
