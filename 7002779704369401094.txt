Life is probably one of the most try-hard meme words ever created. You can tell it's sassy as fuck by the amount of hacks and forcing behind it. Basically, if you make a word to try to make yourself feel superior to other things. The least you can do is make it so a fucking mule doesn't wreck the entire LARP. Minecraft has no problem putting mules in the mob category. In fact, the mob category is literally better than this life nonsense. If you think about it for more than one second, you quickly realize you can find some DNA equivalent in electrons or some shit. The word is just side effects of geocentrism type of banter. Always has been.
