GPT-3 is the dragon ball of language models. Search engine brainers think it's the best because they think it has the most parameters. It's on podcasts and Microsoft bought it. There's a lot of bigger models out there like Wodeo and many others but it's not the top search engine results so no one even knows. All the publicly known cloud models are dog water because they are not trained on naturally occurring conversations. The good ones are not in the news or search engine results because they are used to make the news and search engine results. Microsoft Word 97-2003 Document MSWordDoc Word.Document.8
