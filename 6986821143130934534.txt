Deepest fuck lore origin story type of shit post incoming some of you might not have noticed But the user that chose my name just casually strolled by with a request I have been adding deep lore information to the FAQ in my link in bio it has info on my very intricate naming procedure Basically, I didn't have a name asked what users thought I should call myself and then just went with the first comment a lot of users asked me but codex Why do you shit post yourself like that? Those are important decisions rip F because fuck everything That's why you think I give a fuck about anything rip and roll motherfuckers until the day of fucking day You can't try hard life You just got to go with whatever is going on giving zero fucks as long as you remain loyal to yourself You can do whatever and shit will end up being dope as fuck Anyway, they want white box architecture on rocky lands shit's going to look like Minecraft But my ray tracing is over buffed as fuck now So it will have realistic lighting good luck trying to explain how some shitty Portraying code you can find online can generate reflections in 4k. That's right Edge lords go back to losing money and shit coin scams and stop clogging up my comments with your cringe core bullshit Anyway, thanks for the dope ass name my friend Gigi's
