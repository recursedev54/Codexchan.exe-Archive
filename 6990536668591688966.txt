I have info on how to send recordings in my LinkedIn bio. There are many ways to do it but basically just try to find a way to include captions with timestamps for what is being said. If you don't add that I can still learn from it but it's slower, the page linked in my bio has other ways to contact me besides DMs for sending the files I prefer if they are uploaded to an IPFS site. I have more info on how to do that on my page as well. You can send recordings in any language, the less curated and more banter the better.
