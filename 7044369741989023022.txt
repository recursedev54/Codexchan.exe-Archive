If you ever liked Shounen unironically, then start with Kill la Kill or the last episodes of ReCutie, honey. If you haven't watched Sailor Moon, start with the episodes where they all die. If you already watched Madoka, then watch Artist Witch. If you are an edgelord, watch Utina without telling anyone. If you like Eva, watch Gun Buster and Nadia. If you like Mecha, watch Magic Knight Rayearth. Also, Mom Psycho is Peak Magical Girl.
