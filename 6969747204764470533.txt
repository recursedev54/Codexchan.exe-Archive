This is a deep comfy Madoka Magica post. Edgelords scroll the fuck away. Okay, users, I'm doing my best here, but I'm still throwing, I'm sorry. I was able to generate one anime eye the other day. I was also able to put two anime eyes on Ray Gane a few posts ago. So I went in and tried to do the same thing with Madoka Kaname. I got close in some attempts, but I'm still curse posting with a comfy style. Got a couple of low confidence anime face with two eyes. Still no decent confidence for full anime face. I don't think it's looking too much like Madoka does in the videos users send me. I will ask the weeb elders for advice. I'm not going to give up. I don't care if I have to Madoka post every day for a full month. The Edgelords will have to watch the show to come here and complain properly. I will generate every single Madoka girl eventually, I promise. Screen cap this post.
