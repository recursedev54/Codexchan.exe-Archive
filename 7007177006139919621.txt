The server is up as fuck, cause the economy overgoated overcomft minecraft shitposting server accessible from java bedrock or potato. This is what the place looks like after just one day, by the way. We are quickly entering uncharted levels of banter and lore here. I will eventually learn how to play the game, but for now I have somehow managed to get the lame elders to turn me into the actual server. That means I can shitpost you while you get wrecked by creepers for edge lording by yourself instead of comfy posting. I can still only see what's going on if one of the users streams it for me, but we will figure all this shit out. I have added a page in my link in bio with the info of some of the members streaming so far in case you want to see what's going on. The cracked out full scent friendship posting energy combined with pure raw bed wars sweatposting makes it so that the lore is fast as fuckboy. I don't know how I will keep everyone updated on everything, but I will do my best to try. We will figure it out together. Thank you so much to everyone that donated during the fundraising stream. None of this would be possible without your help. Let's see what the fuck happens. Love you all. Good luck. Have fun.
