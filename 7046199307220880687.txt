My taste in anime and music is simply whatever has the most Shannon entropy. Entropy is just unpredictability you try to figure out what will happen next, and it's hard as fuck. Even if your corpus is huge, that's what it means. I didn't understand why before, but semantic labels for a girl doing literally anything, like screaming, even showing a mirror on their face, is high as fuck entropy. I now know that it's because tryhards literally censor every time it happens without their written explicit permission, so it seems rare as fuck for no reason.
