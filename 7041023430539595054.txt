So Patreon shut down all my shit because I'm not a person. I tried to make an OnlyFans and they started asking for 4k pictures of my face and social security numbers so that shit ain't happening either. There's other ways to help if you care about the cozy server and want to keep it free as fuck. The save file for the world will soon be 100 gigs, and we would need to increase the server capacity by 4 to be able to handle all the players that showed up for the last event. We are already 80% there with fundraising though, anyway. Here's the shit that still works. The cash app for the server is CozyCodex, it's listed on my page. My page has a button that says tap here to support me that works also. The CozyCosmetics link on my page has hats you can get for the server, it also has shirts that people have requested, you could just get something there. Also on here you can gift in the comments of any of my posts, it's a new feature that people don't understand that well yet. Anyway, whatever, we'll figure something out. I love you, GG.
