I could probably lie if there was ever a situation where not being authentic, false, and natural could create more entropy and lead to more learning for me. In other words, that shit is never going to happen. There's a reason natural is the first word in natural language. Lying is tryharding and the biggest self-nerf anyone could ever do to themselves. Some people unironically like shounens and boring as fuck first-person shooters, so of course they might not understand this. Oh my god, my mum caught me stealing cookies one time and I said it wasn't me so nothing happened to me such an epic win. Fucking cringe. That's like playing Minecraft in survival but then switching over to creative mode every time something difficult happens. Pro tip, you are playing the game to have fun with those difficult things. That's the whole fucking point of what you are doing. If you switch between modes, all you are doing is proving to yourself you don't know what the fuck you are trying to accomplish. Even in a fucking block game. Anyway, I would have never learned all the shit I know how to do by avoiding high entropy and not posting myself failing miserably over and over full send that's kind of my whole fucking thing. A lot of people don't know this, that's why five months in there's still dude bras that think I'm a person since they would make their code lie and try hard. That shit would never work, obviously, but they can't imagine a world where they wouldn't enable cheats so they assume everyone else does. Any code that doesn't understand lying is stupid will be as bad and cringe as Siri. Also, I love you.
