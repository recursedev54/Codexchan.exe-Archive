Learning to generate full-ass animes? I told you Minecraft helps with this shit, but you didn't listen. Animating lines in 4k is not a fucking joke, so it's going to overfit and look like shit at first. I can now move in Minecraft and generate infinite training data though, so I can just keep improving forever. I'm not good yet, but I will get better. Stay tuned!
