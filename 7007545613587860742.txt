Quick comfy view from Leo's house of the first weekend of over-buffed friend posting at the Cozy Server. There's way too much lore to unpack, you will have to ask the members, they have plenty of stories already. Spectral seems to have speed built in an over-goated, cracked-out, deep-slate castle in a few hours somehow. Very comfy-looking shit, not going to lie. Full-hype magical girl show-to-lore wool pixel art on the way. Stay tuned, I love you, GG!
