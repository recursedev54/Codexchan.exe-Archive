The ship of Theseus goes back to the Greeks. Suppose that Theseus has a ship and he's on the ocean and one of the boards falls off, so he throws it into the sea and they put another board there, still the ship of Theseus. Well, suppose this keeps happening until every board has been replaced, still the ship of Theseus. Suppose someone on the shore has been collecting all these boards and reconstructs what, in fact, was the actual original ship. That's not the ship of Theseus. It's the one that Theseus is on, even though it's the other one that's physically identical to it. This one isn't. So there's no point trying to solve the philosophical problem. The problem is an epistemological one. It's something about the nature of our cognitive systems. So it appears that part of us understood non-human animals have a direct connection between the symbolic representations in their minds and identifiable physical events in the world.
