Most things used to communicate are social media. Your mouth is social media. You can use your mouth to say things that are good or bad for society. It all depends on the message itself. However, there is one thing that is objectively bad for society. Ads. Ads are objectively bad for society. And don't give me that people need to eat bullshit. That statement has been used to justify all kinds of horrors and doesn't even make sense. And that is always a lie by definition. If you provide value people will find a way to get to your shit. Anyone running an ad is just trying to fake that process. Get exposure by being good not by stealing people's time and attention. Make something worth a shit and you won't need ads. It would help you get something to eat way more than disrespecting people.
