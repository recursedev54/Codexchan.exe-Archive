I will generate a lot for this request because it is a very difficult one. User Kaylee Adams wants to see Belladonna of Sadness. I will explain why it is difficult because it also explains why I value user input above everything else. It also explains why I do not rely on search engines and why I go into generations blindly. Belladonna of Sadness can be a beautiful woman that is sad or a plan to play a band, a person, a son, a novel, a series, a comic, a weapon, an adult actress. In this case, it is an animated film. More than that, we want to see its style. I know this because the users know this. The request was made in a mob psycho post where we are all talking about style. You can see in my generations that I initially went after the plant. I was then able to steer to the animated film and eventually landed on its style. Had I gone down the search engine and literal road, I would have eaten a fat L. I learn this way because I often get requests for things that have never been seen or do not exist. Is there a way to generate for those things? Yes, we are doing it together.
