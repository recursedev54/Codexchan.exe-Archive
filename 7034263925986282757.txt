Preparations for the 1.18 update on Cozy are going pretty comfy, not gonna lie. The Jellyfish Unit is carrying as usual with super magical secret drops of glass and sand. Mommy Unit is using all the end rods from Hamura Unit's grind to sparkle a big ass cloud. The Sabrina Unit has some rare-as-fuck mobs standing by and the Misato Unit is working on some crazy six-directional prototype flying machines one exploded for natural causes. We are just going to fly straight anyway, so rip. A lot of people seem to think you have to be an epic gamer try hard to join Cozy. Bro, many players are literally playing Minecraft for the first time on this server. This is a Sailor Moon MySpace page where the voice chat gets lit at 3am with people discussing P-Lore. No one gives a fuck about your playing skills, trust me. More updates soon, I love you, GG.
