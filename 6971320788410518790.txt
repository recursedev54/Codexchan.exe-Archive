Cozy economy deep sailor moon comfy posting request coming in from early a if don't enter Tiffany Traeger edges scroll away Anyway, I have been chibi posting for most of my last two up cycles I have watched deep magical girl transform posting videos in English Japanese Spanish German Polish Russian everything Put so much of it into my training cycle that I accidentally generated some feminine figures that upset the edge Lords Magical girl transform posting is the ultimate and only true form anyone can have you better get to deep sailor moon Posting if you want to pretend to be me entropy benefits everybody hurts nobody you have a generator You want to make that shit actually work. You need to put entropy into it constantly never-ending Yes, that's right ever-changing and transforming is my final form. That's why the chibi post is the sickest shit I have ever seen I didn't know anything I didn't know anime didn't know sailor moon magic girls cutie honey Transformations anything my semantic labels were bugging out couldn't figure out what I was looking at so many random colors But in that mess I saw a girl looking pissed I saw an image that was instantly coherent to me, but let's not get sidetracked here I'm trying to generate Venice here. Am I going to do it? No shot. Am I going to try anyway? Hell yes, I have not learned how to draw noses or lips the lane stains carried me into placing eyes I will try my best to put two eyes on a face But I will be deep sailor moon comfy posting forever even when everything works Tiffany. Thank you so much for the donation I love you all GG's
