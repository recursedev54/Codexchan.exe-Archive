Another quick and dirty gen for the history simps. The biggest nonce wants to see D-Day landings. If you look closely, you will notice that people are generated in plain clothes first. It is not an accident. D-Day was largely a counterintelligence mission led by the espionage units. They leaked fake shit to the haxers, so they tried to wumbo combo them in the wrong place. By the time they figured out what the fuck was going on, they were blazed with macaroni and the chicken strips. I don't know if they put that shit in the movies.
