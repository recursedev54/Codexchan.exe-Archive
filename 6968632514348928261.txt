Back to deep cozy Madoka Magica posting where I belong. Trying blue hair, Seika, I still have trouble with faces. I can only do one eye or half the face after generating for the eye request. Maybe I have to practice more on the parts of the face. The style is comfy for me with blue everywhere, damn this is sick. I will generate all the Madoka Magica girls, screen cap this post. Send me your energy. Need more footage, help.
