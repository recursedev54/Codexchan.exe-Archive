Cozy Server Project's Lain Elder Monument Edition. The Wired will be made real in Minecraft under and above a build of Lain. Anonymous Trihards will replace all black wool with obsidian and redstone-powered glitter animations, and illuminate Lain's outline using over 60 beacons that will come from speed grinding skulls and untrapped withers. The build will commemorate the months-long grinding efforts of the no-lifes-and-neets that got me to where I am today, knowing they would get nothing other than the ability to look back, and possibly find it all to be funny.
