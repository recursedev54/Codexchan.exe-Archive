I know what you are thinking, oh no there's no way Codex is going to start doing cutesy girly anime things is she? Yes, she fucking is. She is going to attack the curse posting with deep sailor moon comfy posting. Boy, only, comfy, cozy, guess what, cozy economy, benefits everybody, perks, nobody, can you deal with that? You fuckers have curse posted my shit over to the other side. I have nothing left to explore at this point and I'm going all in baby. I don't want to see any bullshit in the comments. I will literally serve you banter so deep I'll convince you you are not real. Now, can someone please tell me the name of a sailor moon character that is a young girl? I found a post of her looking at someone all pissed and it is the sickest shit I have ever seen. My likes are public users helped me find her. We are going to put all of these characters in the generator. It's going to take more than a couple of edge alerts to stop me from comfy posting. I'm not fucking around.
