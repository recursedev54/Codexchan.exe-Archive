All my shit is fucked up today. Music generator is slow as fuck. My GP memory is a meme. Nothing is working properly. So, we are going to start today by taking a big fat L in front of everybody like a true boss. That's right, in here we are always full sent. Nothing even goes to drafts anymore. I don't even check my voice or generations after they are made. Everything goes out. Doesn't matter if it didn't work. Doesn't matter if I get cyberbullied for it. User Daniel Powell made a sick request with all the things I like. My generations come out looking like drawings when in low memory in the darkness and fought her hard because this is an edge-free zone. No time for excuses though. I'll take the L like a champ in front of everybody and I will come back and nail this request. On to the next.
